## Those songs with pithy platitudes are confusing to me

## Why?

## "love is sacrifice"

## I've heard that a lot, but it's logically false and I'm not sure how much I believe it, so there is at best an uncertain relationship

## "sacrifice is for something greater"

## Now I certainly don't buy that, and even if I did, that doesn't necessarily say what it wants to say about love...

## Oh. I don't think about it that much

## Meetup is finding the places where the people you want to meet want to meet people. A schelling problem.
