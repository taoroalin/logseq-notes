## [[Tao Quotes]] Similar to light comes, there is a "thought come" extending infinitely up and down from every thought. Thoughts up from center are about the first, like why did I think this? What inspired this thought? How was this thought formed? What logical form does it take? Those down from center are definitions of constituents of thought, like "the word to here means with the aim of" and down.
### Each of the thoughts 1

### This means that people who disagree will have some part of their idea cones on the top and bottom that agree

## If I didn't just tell you the deepest thing you have ever heard in your life, I failed. Ideas which could be the deepest thing someone has ever heard:
### Godels incompleteness theorem

### Evolutionary biology/signalling

### Implications of true economic agent or AI Safety

### Evolutionary origins of community and spirituality

### Many worlds quantum mechanics

## [[Evolutionary Biology]] Maybe animals as big as elephants can't become dominant like humans because they are too big for the land to support groups sufficiently big to create politics? Populations too small and life cycle too long to capitalize on good climate conditions?
### Chimp groups not that big?
