## [[Rationalism]] utility argument for induction
### There are some things we want

### Thought and rationality are only useful if they get us what we want

### Therefore in order to think usefully, we must assume that thinking can increase utility.

### There are infinite hypotheses that fit all data equally well

### None can be ruled out for other reaskns

### In order for thinking in finite time or space to be useful in that case, the prior probabilities must be a decreasing convergent series

### In order for thinking to be useful, relatively simple hypotheses must be near the beginning

## [[Dream]]
### I was in crackpot philosophy class where tescher looks down at desk, doesn't notice most of class just left, reads book. Classroom is full of random junk, dimly lit.

### She invited me and a young boy to dinner. I took off shirt and pants. I Afterwemt to bathroom. When I got back they were in bathroom, but left their socks at table 

### At convenience store young girl behind me congratulated younger brother for giving tip. Optimistic she's improving the world

### We start taking about philosophy class, whick apparently she takes

### Girl becomes Ora when I'm not looking

### I said how my philosophy professor in real world is much better than in dream. At this point I realize I'm in dream

### I said actually, my dream professor is your professor

### We were talking about lucid dreaming the other day

### Ora says; That's so good, getting joke about how she's a figment of my imagination

### Immediately woke myself up in order to write this journal. Didn't feel like falling, but discontinuity

### Very vivid imagery. Sitting on a railing in front of convenience store seeing parking lot framed by buildings, power lines, street lights reflecting off wet asphalt.

## Fuck it. I keep thinking about my conversations with Luna incessently, so I gotta write it down. These emotions don't seem to be sublimating, so perhaps rational explanation will help. [[Arguments]]

## "Agree to disagree"
### Does this make utilitarian sense? If someone's belief will have moral consequences, then there is reason to persuade them. If not, then the advantage is your knowledge and relationships. If the relationship is very important, then it can outweight the other factors and make a contract not to attempt persuasion rational. Therefore, Agree to Disagree.

### An ideal rational agent will hold the whole set of at all probable models in its mind at once. Because we're only human, it can be valuable to have one person work on each possibility, e.g. insect value or no, AI risk or no instead of all working on everything. Therefore if someone else is contributing to knowledge of a mid-probability theory, bringing them onto the mainline increases risk and expected value.
#### However, if millions are all working on a mid-probability theory, then it is good to convert them to high probability theory.
