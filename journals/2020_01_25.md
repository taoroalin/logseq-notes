## OR

## Use a 16 bit floating-point number representation, as per the IEEE 754-2008 half-precision floating point standard. The bits are split into 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 10 fraction bits. The fraction bits represent a binary fraction between 1 and 2 starting with "1." and then the 10 fraction bits, like 1.011, where only the last 3 bits are fraction bits, which represents $1+1/4+1/8=1.375$. The bits are combined in the form 1.[fraction bits] $\times 2^[exponent bits]$ times -1 if the sign bit is 1. 

## This method represents a different value with each of $2^16$ distinct values, whereas the original representation only has ? distinct values.
