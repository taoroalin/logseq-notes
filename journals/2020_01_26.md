## Perhaps good music follows a rule like "The next note is always not the exact note you expect, not completely random, but perhaps the 5th note down your unconscious probability distribution of next notes

## Would I bet against God existing?
### "God existing" is COMPLETELY different than "observing evidence of God" because any sufficiently powerful and intelligent entity effectively becomes the sole creater of all evidence, regardless of whether that entity is "fundamental to the universe" or anything

### in order for a "there will be no evidence or powerful argument for God" bet to resolve, either such evidence would randomly occur, or God would cause it to appear. If God caused the evidence to appear, then they must have a reason for creating that evidence at that time. If the time frame is my life, there is a priori an extremely low probability evidence would suddenly appear in that time, given that heretics have been around for thousands of years +.

### I would bet 1,000,000:1 that there will be no strong Bayesian reason to expect God's existence within, say, 200 years.

### I would only bet 1,000:1 that God doesn't exist, if such a bet would be resolved after a truly extreme duration with somehow superior evidence/reasoning

### Actually, such a bet isn't meaningful in the same way an ordinary bet is, because money is inherently different under God (specifically under Heaven). By that logic, betting any amount of money may impact your chances at Heaven the same, so you might as well bet infinite wealth that God doesn't exist, since the money would all be meaningless.
