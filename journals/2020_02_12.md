## Is [[Rationalism]] any different than other culture groups? https://rivalvoices.substack.com/p/fuck-it-we-ball-on-rats-postrats
### Postrats replace the "disembodied", 

### "rats disregard aesthetic" is false. HP in HPMOR doesn't love gazing at the stars because of their utility. He does it because they have the right stimulus level, visually relatively low Kolmogorov complexity, is the result of highly complex processes, inspire awe, and represent possibility and power. That **is** a reasonable definition of his aesthetic

### "pretends to be the truth, but is philosophy"
#### If you don't treat everything everyone says as contingent and somewhat philosophical, you are gullible.
