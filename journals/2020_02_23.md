## #Dream Someone went to the grocery(?) store and got killed by a serial killer. I went to said store to investigate/get revenge, saw someone who looked like killer. The I went to the back to a big, somewhat empty room where the (pet supplies/paper towels?) were and the guy followed me. Acted helpful, I grabbed a small hacksaw from shelf (3 saw choices, all sucket but I took the best one). He was standing behind a crete shaped stand of merchandise (teal packaging) and asked if I needed anything. I acted stiff at first, but I needed to get him to let his guard down so I could slit his throat with my saw. I managed to laugh at something he said, (I was far more relaxed than I would expect to be in that situation). I was holding my saw by the tips of my fingers below the box of stuff, and it looked like he was doing similar. I laughed a little more, then slashed at his throat with my saw. He brought his hand up to block, and somehow wasn't even scratched. I was quite screwed, because he was closer to the only door. Then I woke up and miraculously wasn't freaking out.
