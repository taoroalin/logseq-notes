## "Okay, so you want to be honest?" questions. Thinking of having a set of questions that determine whether I make an effort to be truth seeking with someone. They require high openness, but are not infohazards or overly off-putting to normies. Stuff like:
### Does Zeus exist? (or big boy version: Pascal's Wager)

### Do you live in a simulation? (very easy to explain away and forget, only an infohazard to the best :)

## #Investing Complete noob, but its prediction practice.

## Single greatest danger is get lost in myth. Other hazard is mistake disienchanent for wisdom.
