### Everything is normally cohered, but your actions can isolate systems to allow them to behave quantum-ly

## Jupyter notebooks should really be replaced with something that lets you make your program declaratively and intelligently caches results after long computations so you don't have to manually reevaluate anything

## Programming environment for data science or other contexts in which input data doesn't change that live updates its IR of your code and caches results of computations and updates on changes to
