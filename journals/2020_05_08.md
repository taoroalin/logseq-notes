## #Calva improvements
### Fix new close paren instead of pass through paren after cursor leaves and comes back to sexp #paredit [[DONE]]
#### it's VSCode's autoCloseBrackets

### Make paredit operations work on all cursors when multiple cursors are used 

### Fix "recur must be in tail call position" error message in debugger when recur is in the body of an if #debug

### make paredit stricter--make ) key do nothing when there is nothing to close

### set it up to not spawn new window whenever I jack in

### Make inline evaluation result wrap lines

### syntax highlight (rainbow parens) prints

### core lib not referred immediately after starting repl

### slurp doesn't seperate tokens

## Thinking thought stuff
### https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/ Why would it be optimal to encode things using physical universes? although they can contain all possible strings, the information you need to locate those strings is as long as the strings themselves
#### malign prior argument
##### Rich physical worlds can be described by simple laws

##### those worlds can have consequentialists living inside them

##### these simulated worlds could be optimal for kolmogorov encoding

##### then the consequentialists can control the universal prior in other universes that can simulate them

##### My thoughts:
###### Even if this works with the OG Solomnoff prior, it breaks down using any sort of approximation, because these simulations require lots of complexity that seems "superfluous" to the actual information being encoded
####### but don't all realistic solomonoff encodings?

###### This depends on the entire gambit of consequentialist thought, like
####### computable consciousness (or at least strong agents)

####### [[Full Laws and Initial Conditions]]

####### lots of consequentialists in our anthropic class

####### eventual simulation of inhabited universes

#### He speculates earth life will understand full physical laws **and initial conditions** in next billion years

#### two universes that both know their laws and initial conditions, and each one is simulating the other

#### The universal prior is really weird
##### I would stay away from it unless you understand what you are getting

### Holy shit this may be my favorite blog post ever: https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/01/the-hour-i-first-believed/
#### the "convenient after you die" part is bs and thus the shortcomings of this universe are strong evidence against this, the same perrenial problem with theism

### Real numbers, and sets, and logical statements, have all started feeling to me like Cthuluesque monstrosities whose appearances are only tolerable because we only look at the pretty parts of them and don’t let ourselves look at the horrors that lurk below
#### and from the above, programs and universal priors as well

## Minimum Circuit Size Problem: If MCSP is easy, then there is no cryptographically-secure one-way function.
### Can circuits be reversed more easily than algorithms?

## Buck Schlegris is now one of my favorite bloggers
### I also overrated conventional wisdom about factual claims about how the world worked, though I underrated conventional wisdom about how to behave

### This would suggest the heuristic “Take received wisdom on topics into account, even if you ask people where the received wisdom comes from and they tell you a source that seems extremely unreliable”.
#### I think this should be "If someone (or some culture) has experience and extensive feedback in a field, then they will have untransferrable knowledge that you just have to trust until you can discover it yourself" #[[Tao Quotes]]

### (One of my favorite topics is how the quantum mechanics of electrons lead to the features of chemistry that we need for life. I hope to write something one day about it, but it’s pretty hard to explain briefly. I enjoy attempting to explain it in person, though.)
#### I need to hear this!

### Life took 1.4 * 10^32 femtoseconds, and red dwarves last like 3.2 * 10^35 femtoseconds, which isn’t that much leeway. (I’m unsure whether this is an appropriate comparison to make.)
#### Here's what this might be saying: if abiogenesis has some poisson process elements that took around 4 billion years to happen, then another 4 billion years doesn't make a huge difference
##### Life actually started on the order of millions of years after the earth formed, not billions. Really depends on drake weightings

### Biological life is heavily optimized for evolvability
