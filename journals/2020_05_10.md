## q language
### encapsulate ancilla inputs and outputs within functions
#### when ancillas aren't uncomputed, return map, which has [:output main-output :input main-input :whatever-else something]

#### or maybe i only need input and output keys?

### What if you have the ability to name arbitrary results in nested functions?
#### scoped to everything even or enclosed? (+ 1 (#this-thing-called-1 + 1 1) (+ 1 this-thing-called-1)) is unclear

#### (measure ("name 1" (operation data)))

#### (measure (:input "name 1"))
