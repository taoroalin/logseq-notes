## I don't want the same things out of a theory of consciousness as qri?
### I don't get the pallete problem. It seems to me like there would be either 0, 1, or more pallete options, and if there are more than 1 i don't really care how many there are.

## Simulating universes with agents that "feel as natural as ours does from the inside?" #Crux
### Because: This opens up acausal trade between our and other universes

### Variants:
#### Simulation possible in our universe

#### Simulation only possible in other unvierses?
##### How would we ever know this?
###### Simulation break out

## How resilient is KC to choice of programming language? They only differ by a constant factor, but is that similar enough?
