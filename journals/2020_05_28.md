## Boltzmann Brains aka Freak Observers
### Is a BB observing random observations higher K complexity than one with structured observations

### "However, cognitive instability is not evidence that we are not BBs. Don Page wrote that invoking a new scientific principle just to escape BBs is non-economical"
#### I guess this makes sense, because if you have a utility function than possibilities which contain no utility are irrelevent to decisions

### They estimate 10^6 bits to an Observer Moment. 

## How can I add an "super macro" functionality that lets a macro evaluate to more than one value in the enclosing sexp?

## What if clojure replaced the duo of lists / vectors with 1 thing: reversed vectors. This would allow you to cons to the front of the vectors just like lists, and index them like vectors. conj'ing onto the back of vectors is cool, but not super important. Lookup by index in vectors is very useful, and it's currently hard to tell what's a map and what's a vector

## Could you create __if__ in clojure if it didn't already exist?
