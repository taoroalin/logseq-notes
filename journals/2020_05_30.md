## My problem: how do I make a spec that's like s/cat but that ignores some of the args when conforming?

## Poly Bridge
### Cost proportional to length, no overhead

### Basic Span
#### 5 Road 3.5Pg
##### Default Straight: 7068

##### Skinny Straight: 5986

##### Skinny Straight Road: 5619

##### Sknny Straight Pointy: 5750

##### Hang Reinfored Road
