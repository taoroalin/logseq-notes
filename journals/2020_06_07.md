## poly bridge weights
### All building materials are the same weight

### Building material weights don't depend on length

### Road weight is 60% fixed and 40% based on length
#### 0.75+0.25*length in meters

### Reinforced roads are only 25% heavier than normal roads
#### 15/16+5/16*length in meters

### above equations seem __almost__ right...

### Roads are 5x heavier than building materials

### material per 2m
#### wood : 0.25

#### road : 1.25

#### reinforced road : 1.5

#### rope : 0.25

#### cable : v

#### steel : 0.25

#### hydraulic : 0.25

#### steel : 0.25

#### spring : 0.25

## Analogy of deep learning to progressively uncrumpling paper with a line on it - very good

## #Clojure ->RecordName means create record, not thread-record!
