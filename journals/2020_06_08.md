#### The gold standard for a lot of this is to randomly assign people to... actually this is so entangled!!!!

#### maybe some evidence
##### most non-status-seeking successful people don't credit education for much

##### therefore it's likely the status seeking people who cite college as important to their development are just signalling

### [[Lee Kuan Yew]]
#### On the night of 14 August 1983, I dropped a bombshell in my annual National Day Rally address. Live on both our television channels, with maximum viewership, I said it was stupid for our graduate men to choose less-educated and less-intelligent wives if they wanted their children to do as well as they had done.
##### So that's why #Visaken joked about his singaporean uncle being disappointed in his performance in bed!

## Experiments in conversational lisp
### I didn't realize how much freedom english gives you to restructure your sentences half way through. 

## https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4361 #AKC talked about recording and narrativising his subculture too

## https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1987-rossi#some-laws-of-evaluation quite good! I need more evidence on the [[short termist]] vs [[LongTermism]] debate (#GiveWell vs #LongTermism)

## [[Newcomb's Problem]] If my date gave me the problem, like Julia Galef's, what would I do?
### One-box as practice to become more of an updateless decision theorist

### One-box to signal how rational and stable I am

### One-box to signal that I respect their intelligence and won't try to trick them

### Two-box to show that me advocating for UDT doesn't mean we're ready to use UDT yet, and that we can't actually predict each other that well

### Two-box because if I one-box they might not tell me what they put in the other box and I'm curious
