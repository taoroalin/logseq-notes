## I just played one of my favorite games of MTG - it was workshop black mirror, and the awesome part was that both of us had Bolas's Citadel out, and I used a fizzle interaction to win while my opponent frantically played instants off Bolas's Citadel to escape. 

## Judging how well you 

## New MTG format: Pure Storm. The differences between it and normal are that all spells are given flash, and instead of holding priority, priority automatically goes to the other player after one puts something on the stack, then if they pass goes back to the first player. If the first player passes, the step ends. This is meant to allow two storm/stack based decks go off simultaneously and interact more. 
### Possible Names: Stack MTG, Pure Storm, Pure Stack

### In an extreme version, there could be no combat step, just to drive home that you're supposed to win off spells and triggers, not creatures
