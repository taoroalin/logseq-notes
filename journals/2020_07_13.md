## #MTG
### #MK vs Uro
#### Loss, quite long game

#### my only instant was Tale's End, which only had 2 targets because they only cast Uro once. I didn't have enough dorks, or good interaction. They got Kogla early, as well as Gargaroth

#### 

### #MK vs Daxos
#### folded to agent

#### turn 5 win

### #MK vs Garruk Unleashed
#### turn 3 win

#### folded to quench

### #MK vs Garruk Unleashed
#### ~turn 7 win, close game

#### folded to mass manipulation

### #MK vs Garruk Cursed
#### Turn 5 win

### #MK vs Sorin Vengeful
#### Loss

#### board wiped, then missed land drops. I drew 1 counter, quench. Could have saved it for the board wipe. Given that WB vampies isn't strong, probably should have saved it. My only insurance creature was Cavelier of Thorns, and I goofed the trigger by getting mass manip without the bluee

### #MK vs Nissa
