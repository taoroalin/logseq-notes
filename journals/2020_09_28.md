## Corin:
### what to do about inputs within a form not crossing shadow barrier?

### I wasn't able to remove IE clear field X

### Do we want to support "disabled class" like vanilla?

### Create external button temporarily or permanently for form integration

### External replicas to circumvent shadowdom don't nest well. Is this ok?

### focusBtn vs setFocus

### How does url work with slot? if slot is a div or whatnot, functioning as a link won't be accessible
#### options:
