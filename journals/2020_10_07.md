## maximal square
### check for squares with top left corners in every location, but stop when we get too close to the edge and skip squares that already have a hole

## Lowest Common ancestor binary tree
### Note: this is not a binary search tree!

### Recursive: 
#### if node is null, return false

#### if the current node is equal to p or q, return it

#### if fn(right) and fn(left), return current node

#### else return fn(right) or fn(left)

#### (by or mean JS or)

### search for and record routes to each, then follow them until they diverge

## Count Complete Tree Nodes
### Didn't find a way to leverage "complete binary tree" property. Just added all nodes together

### ok, once I heard about it, there is one. You use binary search on the length of the bottom row.
