## timing tests:
### spec: 6.8s

### all: 12.0s

## Programming language with strict opt-ins
### What this means: A programming language where each function, class, file, or module has has opt-in strictness requirements, such that composing strict modules guarentees a strict result.
#### For example, you could define `functional function add(a, b)`. The `functional` tag means that the function is guarenteed to have no side effects, and adding one would throw a compiler error. Similarly, you could have a `typed function add(a:int, b:int)-> int`, which must be proven to return the correct type given correct input types. You could also have `OO class myClass` which is guaranteed to not directly access fields of other objects and whatever. This would allow you to build a program with strictly proven properties inside a general purpose language
