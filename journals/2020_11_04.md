## [[ttc]]2:
### animate tab switch on sidebar?

### animate tab switch on menu, or top style?

## [[ttc]]:
### Does querying or otherwise finding children of tab/others matter to users?
#### <div slot="head" body-id="thebody"><div slot="body" id="thebody>
##### add listener to existing slot elements

#### copy outer html of childen

#### move children into dom

### <div

### review multi-select?

### speed findings

## Todo:
### merge selected options when options change

### show what options are filtered out but still selected
#### grey out and show selected but filtered out

### Stop copying outside shadowdom to access forms

### synchronize objects to component props

### make checkbox functional component shared between standalone and embedded

### call watch[prop] automatically on first componentWillRender

## Can a neural network build a neural network? yes, in theory.

## in commander, if you need your draw step, you're doing it wrong. If you don't need your untap step, you're doing it right.

## aian 124 provably safe exploration via shielding
### neurosymbolic rl formally verified exploration
#### shield: safe set of states and actions
##### why is this framed as set instead of hard code boolean function (s,a)=>safe?

#### create shield for policy
##### precompute per policy

#### Worst case dynamics model

#### prove shielded policy is closed under worst case transition

#### inductive safety invariant: all initial + closed under worst case transition

#### How can worst case transition be less than full transition? How will you know not to burn Benjamins if your worst case transition never lets you get benjamins in the first place?

#### deterministic piecewise linear policies

#### safe symbolic policy -> invert to neorosymbolic policy->safe

## Electroweak Theory and the Origin of the Fundamental Forces
### Only global phase is unmeasurable. Phase difference between waves is measurable
