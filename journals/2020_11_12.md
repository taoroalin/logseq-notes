### Strip power cord, make spark in more convenient location

### Light candle from another candle

### Light from stove

### Light from oven

### Put fire starting stuff + 2 or more pieces of metal in the microwave

### Put candle on tree or roof, hope lightning strikes

### Magnifying glass

### Laser

### Spark plug from car engine

### Light from exhaust of car (may need to tune car first to make exhaust firy)

### bring candle to the sun

### give the candle to someone else and hope they eventually light it for their own purposes

### Leave candle in public space, hope someone takes it and lights it

### Light off of wild fire

### Put candle in box with air and throw into deep space, hope it eventually quantum tunnels into a lit state

### Light it off of dark thing in hot sun

### Light with electricity generated from treadmill / stationary bicycle

### Light with electric only cigarrete lighter

### Break natural gas pipe, hope something ignites gas + candle eventually

### Light off of electric heater

### Light with exhaust from firearm

### Stuff candle in barrel of firearm

### Drag wick between two pieces of paper, maybe lights from friction

### Cut some of candle off of wick to light more easily with above method

### Write proof that simulation exists that somehow depends on candle not spontaneously lighting, then simulation controllers will light candle for you to protect simulation secret
#### felt like i had to because everyone else uses simulation

### Put candle inside LHC

### replace duterium pellet in ignition fusion experiment with candle

### light candle with plasma from tokemak

### Light with rocket engine

### It turns out the candle is just a picture of a candle, draw yellow + red on it

### Throw picture of candle in fire

### Use candle as wad of shotgun

### Throw small square of high friction paper at candle wick, cutting it in half and lighting it with friction in the process

### Remove battery from phone, touch battery leads together to start fire

### Climb power pole, make spark to light candle

### Put flammable oil something in saucepan on induction stove, light candle

### Use pascal's mugging to coerce someone into lighting candle for you

### Make advertisement for candles, causing people to buy candle and light it

### Manufacture more candles, so there's more chance one of them will be lit

### Keep candle in secure vault prior to lighting so it can't be destroyed first

### Read literature on formal definition of fire so you can be completely sure whether the candle is actually lit

### Submerge most of candle in cold water so you don't accidentally melt all the wax off in your attempt to light candle (would be a shame to fail like that)

### Conduct a thorough chemical profiling and and CAT scan of candle to make sure there are no explosives hidden inside before you light it

### Teach humanoid robot to light candle for you

### Make pre-lit candle dispenser with built in lighter, then load it with the candle

### Light candle with controlled gas lighter in QA testing at candle factory

### Write in your will that you want your candle to be lit

### Fire your candle, hire a new candle and light that one

### Hope cosmic rays light your candle

### Fly in hydrogen balloon to increase your chance of getting lit by cosmic rays

### Blow up said hydrogen baloon to light candle

### Submerge your candle in liquid oxygen, wait for candle to spontaneously combust

### Find bacteria that can eat your candle. Its calories will have been 'burnt', so therefore the candle must have been 'lit'.

### Drop candle in lava lake

### Drop candle in molten metal in foundary

### Touch wick to heating elements in toaster

### Just put the candle in the toaster

### Drill holes in candle to 'lighten' it

### light candle with blowtorch

### Shove stick through candle and roast like marshmellow over campfire

### Time travel back to when the candle was still petroleum in the ground, blow that up with nuke

### Build a wooden bridge from an already lit candle to the target candle, which burns and lights target candle

### Lay additional candle wick between other lit candle and target candle

### Light candle with plutonium radiothermal power source

### Light candle with heat from geothermal water based power plant

### Rub hands together so hard they light candle

### Light candle with dozens of high-wattage spotlights

### Plant ultradense material inside candle wick, then light with high energy neutrino beem

### Light candle with cold-candle-seeking missile

### Tell people this particular candle is immune to lighting so they try to light it

### Make real life fire breathing dragon, then have it light the candle

### Do nothing, because after the candle's protons decay they will enter a new Penrose cycle universe and become another candle that someone else will light

### Trigger vacuum collapse. The energy released with the candle collapses is kinda like "lighting"

### Throw molotov cocktail at candle

### Focus sunlight with mirrors

### Focus moonlight with mirrors onto steam engine, which generates electricity, which powers electric lights, which are focused with mirrors onto candle. (because moonlight is too low frequency to light candle)

### Focus starlight with mirrors of ridiculous size onto candle

### Burn candle in incinerator made for corpses

### Light candle in pressure cooker

### Boil candle in oil

### Boil candle in water until water boils off and candle lights
