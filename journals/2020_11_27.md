## #VSCode ctrl enter is git commit

## #Project idea: make 4d toys for quest, but with projection in addition to slice

## I love the words snake_case, kebab-case, camelCase

## my #Favorite shape is Great Stellated 120 Cell

## #Haskell it's confusing how haskell uses a type for each different group. For example, there's the "multiplication" group, and the "addition" group, there's no compiler knowledge that they have the same underlying representation.

## hy don't node watch scripts watch for config files / the script being run istelf to change?

## Why don't I type faster? Why do I take so ling to warm up to typing each day/time I sit down?
### Should I practice typing every morning when I sit down at the computer? Might make it harder to get stuck/frustrated early while working 

## Why does stencil create "build" pseudo directory? Why not make everything actually in one real life file?

## How to get storybook working on 

## Plan:
### Get storybook working DigiKey

### Spend at least 3 hours on programming project

### Apply for a job I like

## #DigiKey I want to see the storybook and build processes seperately. Can I do this without manually starting two terminals?

## #DigiKey start process
