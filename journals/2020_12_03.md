### "I spent 10 months going in, and it took 10 months to get back normal functionality"

### "I was doing acid and I realized if I kept doing this I would eventually not get food and die, so I asked myself, do I want to live? and I answered yes, and that's the first time I'd tried to preserve my identity in 10 months"

### "Now everything I did i did because I didn't want to die. I cleaned my room because I didn't want to die. Everything had meaning."

### "It feels like everything's in a sandbox"

### "I was terrified of being homeless"

### "Now that you're okay with everything, nothing's off limits"

### "Ok, I guess I'm insane now" (giggly voice)

### "If you scream while you're geting spanked, you get spanked again"
#### this gave me intimate experience with pain

#### "I don't care how much pain there is going on, I just submit"

#### "Twelve times, I broke you. Remember that"

### "Morality by definition can't change, so why did it change between old and new testament"

### "Realized I was putting in so much effort to make this literal bible stuff make sense. Lost my faith in an instant"

### "and then I suddenly became an extrme slut. the norms around that hadn't been super ingrained in me"

### interviewer: experiment where women and men go up to people on college campus and straight up ask for sex. no women said yes, some men said "why tonight, why not right now?"
#### I have an idea. Take the hottest male psych professor (there are 2 at UBC) and have them ask their own female students for sex. I predict that far more of them would say yes than to random grad students.

### "at the factory I had becky"

### I realized men like thinking they beat other men to get you.

### men like intimacy

### hadn't watched romantic movies, hadn't flirted

### [[Aella]] makes $100,000 a MONTH on onlyfans

#### hired someone to program her a thing to make her top post on nsfw reddit. wow.

#### Taking most popular videos from girls on tiktok and doing them naked worked really well

#### **Just take all the things that make someone want to watch someone else online, from youtube, tiktok, porn, ect, and just do them all at once on onlyfans**

### consciousnes
#### we need a different frame for consciousness

### How far along am I (if at all)? how good is it?

## [[Roam]][[How To Use]]
### Use multiple small tags next to each other for queryability

### When summerazing a subject, don't have to use page itself. Can just summerize in daily notes. Maybe use [[Summary]] tag.

### [[roam/css]]

### to get hired by Roam do you need to have that hairstyle? luckily I kinda do!

## Chrome web store disables all extensions. Makes sense, an extension could go haywire.

## I really need to improve my Roam usage to research more (and more productively). 
### What do I want to [[Research]]? 20 minute babble 22:40
#### Periwinkle

#### Lifestyle changes for better performance / [[qualia]].
##### oxidation?

##### low grain?

##### low chemical?

##### low processed?

##### Frequent mid exercise?

##### heavy excercise?

##### psychedelics?

#### [[Self Improvement]] I hear a lot of good self improvement advice, and I often keep it in mind for a few days, but I should really accumulate a list of self improvement tips and go through them. 
##### perhaps pick one or two a week, and bring them up twice a day

##### [[Self Improvement]] sources: [[48 Laws of Power]] [[Almanack of Naval Ravikant]] [[Tim Ferris]] [[High Output Management]] [[Replacing Guilt]] [[Waking Up]] 

#### [[Deep Understanding / Replicating]]. If I want to become an expert in an EA subject, I need to understand literature to the point of replicating it. I may want to do this in a few fields:[[AI Safety]] [[Broad Longtermism]] [[Social Persistence]]

## I had this great idea a few years ago and then [[Forgot]] it. it's something about defining things in terms of how your prediction accuracy of them changes over time. If you can predict something more accurately as time progresses, then it doesn't have [[intelligence]]. if it is easier to predict farther in the future (or if it has some other non-increasing prediction curve) it's intelligent.

#### [[Try Once]]: a situation where you get one shot. if you miss, you'll never get it.
##### [[Giacomo]] argues that we had a Try Once opportunity to get good socialist revolution. This seems like weak dreaming. there's no reason to believe that it would have been dramatically different. it's just an excuse

##### What are real examples of Try Once?
###### getting into college (undergraduate)

###### test scores

###### Those are things that mostly reveal an hidden variable, not opportunities to do something. The relevent probability is whether you were born for it + chance, not something that can be forecasted more accurately as the time approaches.

## Quick update: I've worked for 10 hours. I threw out everything I wrote in the first 5 hours that used compiled css instead of functions. I have made some progress using LESS programming, which includes: hover:text-red-400, placeholder:bg-blue-400, p-r-10 (padding right 10), flex-col, and a few more. Because I badly misunderstood the problem at first, I will continue working a bit more.

## [[[[Tailwind]] to [[LESS]]]]

## {{Todo null}} [[December 3rd, 2020]] [[7 GUIs]] [[Cells]] get fibinacci 100 working in under 300ms

## [[Cells]] [[Change Propagation]]
### Traverse with seen list, mark all as dirty

### Make stack of just changed cells
#### Until stack is empty

#### pop top of stack. if everything it depends on is clean, 

#### Check push everything that depends on it to the stack

### Could use a heap with number of dirty dependencies
#### Heap algorithm is O(changes*average_dep_count)

## [[Cells]] should I use a ranges map, or AST caching to speed up range calculations?

## [[Clojure]] make macro for _ (println "x" x)
