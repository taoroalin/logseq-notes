## [[Parser Abstraction]][[Roam Parser]]
### definitely a, maybe interspersed with b: `b?(a b?)+`

### some sequence (of at least one) from a list: `(a|b|c...)+`

### Roam double "quote", [[, {{, **, ^^, ect: `<"qq">inner<"QQ">`

### Italic, Bold, and Highlight can nest within each other, but not within themselves
#### this is better handled by eagerness/greediness than constraints!

#### I need to ensure that there's no ** inside bold, but also need to parse what's inside

#### https://roopc.net/posts/2014/markdown-cfg/ yes this is a real hard question

#### I need a sort of "function", like "highlight of a __"

#### If I add exact lookahead, where you look ahead exactly the same number of chars as the next thing consumes, that will solve it.

### [[Instaparse]] already has span metadata and `insta/span`

## [[Roam Parser]]
### Should I hide things like `<"[[">`? it's what I normally do, but it requires me to seperately define "inverse parse" functions.

## [[Protein Folding]][[AI]][[RobinHanson]] he credits a paper saying alphafold 2 will have small impact. The paper looks very unconvincing to me. It's argument goes like "It's accuracy is only X, while current drug discovery practices use measurements of Y accuracy, 3 times more." This doesn't take into account new workflows built around alphafold 2. It sounds similar to arguments "vaccines can't be made in a year, that's just not how it's done" that [[Superforecasting]] believed in the early days of the pandemic and have gone back on.

## [[Blogs]] https://knowingless.com/ [[Aella]]
### This has the same commentor default profile pics as [[SlateStarCodex]]. Where does the code come from?

### Psychadelic people are likely more drawn to these images than others?

### Had the thought "what's Aella's real name?". after seeing [[SlateStarCodex]] debacle, it would be worse for me to know her name than not.

## [[Almanack of Naval Ravikant]]
### If you want to be successful, surrount yourself with people more successfulthan you. if you want to be happy, surround yourself with people less successful than you are.

### [[Blogs]] if someone shows a rationality error, drop everything they've said ever.

### Don't make an investment out of fomo

### Suffering is the point when you're forced to face reality
#### why not "all feelings come when you face reality"?

## What if I made a goal to type fast enough to transcribe a podcast at 2x speed?

## [[Personal Pitch]][[For Normies]]

## [[Cells]][[7 GUIs]]
### Speed up Paste CSV. Right now it takes 4s to paste to 2700 cells.
#### All time is spent in `(reduce #(apply add-cell %1 %2) state updates)`

#### Try batching updates.

### [[Change Propagation]] Full algorithm implemented!
#### inputs: State with some Dirty

#### Extend Dirty
##### Set of done = #{}, set of todo = Dirty

##### While there is todo
###### Pop todo, add to done, for each of its backlinks not in done, add to todo

##### return state with dirty set to done

#### Put dirty in sorted set like #{_dirty_dep_count_ _pos_}

#### Create map of {pos dirty_dep_count}

#### While there are dirty
##### pop lowest dirty dep count. if it's nonzero, there is recursion. otherwise,

##### evaluate popped

##### for each of its deps, remove current entry from sorted set based on dirty dep map, then add to sorted set

## How to make it handle very large numbers of dependencies per cell
### cache result in each ast node. links list is now [ast-node]

### how to refer to ast node? get-in vec? [0 1 4 2]... ect? direct reference doesn't work in immutability

### whenever we see we've completed a dep, we add/subtract from corresponding ast node. this works for ref and sum, does not work for average node. Can have function specific to each ref node type

### each range op treats diffs in inputs differently. for example, a max range only updates if the old value is the max or the new value is above max.

## Is it a good idea to use `i'm still using this /today` ? 

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] make backtick type-over

## [[Roam]][[Applications]] making a parser for Roam sounds like fun. I will work on that [[Low Priority]] https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/NYgRwJaQM [[Roam Parser]] i'm still using this [[December 5th, 2020]]
### This time I won't contact [[Conaw]] until I'm satisfied with it. This likely means it will be mostly done after 50% time

### What's the structure of the Roam syntax?
#### Aliasable - in order to be aliasable as in `[![img](image-as-alias.com)](www.roamreasearch.com)` something must not render as a link itself. so it's actually called **non-link**

#### $$latex$$ `$$latex$$`can't have anything else inside it

#### What can be highlighted?
##### only pure text, italic, or bold. They can nest inside each other, but not inside themselves.

## [[Roam Parser]] questions
### Does this just parse one cell, or the markdown export version with ` - block`?

### How should it handle whitespace? as far as I know auto-whitespace would work

## [[Roam]][[Bug]] just now when I clicked a cell, my cursor appeared and immediately vanished. Block was rendered as plaintext, like I'm editing, but can't type or see cursor. Could be because of the [[roam/css]] I have

## [[Roam]] md export is same as copy paste, right?

## [[Changed My Mind]] I have potential as a programmer. I just need to work hard.

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] 
### make it work better with [[Vimium]]. Most important make notes focusable with `gi` on page load

### make [[roam/css]] more accessible, builtin with like 3 clicks

### stop miniscule height change when stop editing

## [[Changed My Mind]] everyone's always asking each other this. It's also a very good idea to track for myself.

## [[Changed My Mind]][[GHD]] ((a54d59b4-cc61-4bb0-9ca5-39e9ead25615))

## [[Changed My Mind]][[Fermi Paradox]][[Great Filter]] now I think it's likely behind us ((54da10d6-6b2b-4a32-8f77-82f28f4834d4)) need to actually read paper, [[Reading List]] remind again

### much more sense of adventure, much less vision. Also much 

## My fingers are itchy! I need to type! unfortunately my [[Cells]] coding is in an optimisation slow-coding mode, so if I want to type fast I need to write here or code something new.

## I really think it's best to store all information in Roam, but I don't do that very well right now, mainly because I don't have enough total information (and I haven't organized it great)

## I said I would set aside some time a week for [[Reading List]] but I haven't actually. 
### [[December 5th, 2020]] {{Todo null}} spend 2 hours on my reading list

## [[roam/css]] I like this style. It's not perfect, but it's dark, and I can see stuff, so :)
### Can't see brackets under highlight

## [[K/DA]][[K Pop]] Why do I like this music so much? How is K-pop actually made? I hear it's made very big-corp style, but what does that mean? How many people compose + write song? How much input does talent have?

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]]
### Make it easier to add text to a block with an image, like by clicking on it
