## 

## concat binary [[Leetcode]]. 

## [[Roam Parser]] From Scratch
### keep a stack of "block" starts
#### **,^^,__,[[,((,{{,`, code block, ect

## [[Roam Parser]] Need to give some things priority over earlier things. for ex. `**this might be [[Bold ** Page]]`. Also needs to support `** thing [[ **`.
### Prior Work: https://github.com/danneu/klobbdown/blob/master/src/klobbdown/parse.clj 
https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/master/src/Parser.js

### 

## 

## [[Wellbeing]][[Measurement]] mindfulness

## [[Calva]][[Improvements]] auto namespaces without project name.

## [[Instaparse]][[VSCode]] bugs
### Handle dashes in terms

### Handle quotes

### show escaped characters light colored

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] it's hard to remove a code block.

## ```yaml
here is my code
in a language```

## [[Roam Parser]] swap ast node and text at the same time: can use instaparse start tag ability to parse the new text in the current context. if it doesn't parse, can throw error or insert and reparse whole thing
### Need a good interface for reverting nodes to plaintext if their content doesn't work (eg block ref id is invalid)

### Make list of nodes that can "fail" (based on content may be rendered as plaintext)

### Maybe it's worth it to make parser with combinator library for expressivity & integration
