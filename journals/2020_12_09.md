## [[Dream]]
### I'm downstainrs in data's baseent. I am hungry, he gives me weird snacks. Accellerators, sound like they're addons for nerf, actually he eats. He was on video call. I was jealous.  

## [[Applications]][[For Normies]]
### I've been passionate about programming since I was 9 years old

### I was in college. I thought I could get more done outside of college, so I dropped out, worked on an independent project, an internship. 

### At my internship I've written well over 10,000 lines of code

### Why do I love programming? Coming from a mechanical engineering background, I love being able to build whatever I want, whereever I want, without materials costs or workshops. I find software elegant.

### I have experience working 80 hour weeks

### I love programming

### I have programming knowledge

### Communication issues
#### I've come a long way in my communication skills. I recently made my communication with my boss at my internship much better by keeping a list of issues to talk about between meetings. 

### Good job tao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Noticing when people have something to say but won't talk over others to do so.

## [[Rationalism]][[Taleb]] Irrationality as baked in consideration of black swans
### This is an [[Update]] for me. I believed things like "people take lower risks than is rational." I did know that nonlinear returns on wealth make those calculations harder, but I didn't think about how optimal societies contain non-self-interested members.
