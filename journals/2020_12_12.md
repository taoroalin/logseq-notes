### >If you’re working with a system you don’t understand, you’re limited to debugging via guess-and-check, which can be arbitrarily slow. A more efficient method would be to [get as much information as possible about your program’s execution](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1265360282513281025?lang=en) and then use that information to exclude most of the hypothesis space. But this requires a good understanding of both the system, and the tools available for inspecting it. If you’re tracking down, say, a networking problem, staring at some tcpdump output will often get you most of the way there, but only if you know how to interpret it and what to look for.

## #Codenames #AI [[Language Model]] my codenames warmup: go through all 25 cards in a row, and for each one think of at least one previous card it relates to. I use this to "load up" or  "memorize" all the cards before the game. This is reminiscent of [[Transformer]]s

### He's dragging text to copy -- this is bad. why?

### Uses #Quotes, [[Key Terms]], [[Paraphrase]]? [[]]

### Uses dashed names: #Return-On-Investment

### Uses keyboard shortcut for make to link

### He repeats keys already used in title in [[Key Terms]]
