## Compiler is on a spectrum with metaprogramming. Programming language is also metaprogramming library where ```javascript
while (cond){body}
```

is a function that takes in two programs and produces composite program
```
reg<-cond
conditional_goto reg 7
body
goto 4
```
### metaprogramming and compiler are same thing.

### splitting that code block in two was painful [[Roam]][[Improvements]]

## Need [[Keyboard Shortcuts]] for youtube control (forward, back 10s) while focused in [[Roam]]

## #roamdocs [[Group Roam]]

## [[Roam]] should I be capitalizing my links?

## [[Roam]] keeps your place when stuff above you gets bigger. It might do this by 

## I should find audiobooks

## coze algorithm usually converges in a sense, but doesn't start with defaults that do that. [[Roam]] coze was stopped early and had two nodes right on top of each other

## I have eight screens of stuff today! that's probs a record

## How does / should encyrption work in Roam? how can you index links inside of encrypted thing and show backlinks?
### one answer: just don't allow links in encrypted part

## once double clicking on youtube title selected following space too, once it didn't. why?

## Heard [[Sam Altman]] say that speed responding to emails is the #1 predictor of success. I took that advice seriously, and it's been good for me so far.

#### [[Tyler Cowen]]and[[Patrick Collison]] talked to #NIH and #NSF . Launched [[Fast Grants]] a week later. within 2 weeks made 100 grants. 4000 applications. at least 3000 of them were very sensible, plausibly worth funding

#### Are big institutional labs still good? Xerox parc was super good. parc was good because it paid people tons.
##### Now we can't do that anymore because normies know smart people are useful and pay them lots too

#### hard to think of any major successes from industrial labs in the last 15 years. 

#### Endless fronteir speach

#### Damn [[Patrick Collison]]'s website style hasn't been changed since 2006. literally less than 1 page of css in the whole thing.

##### purpose, autonomy, sense of mastery, the team around them, (maybe purpose)

##### great founder becomes ceo of existing corp, probs nothing much can be done

###### 37 years projected (likely more) time for california high speed rail

#### #AI he doesn't know. thinks people who think they know are wrong. thinks near term agi can't be dismissed. Inevitability is overstated because we don't actually understand human brain and can't say what we do is similar.

#### frustrating that low hanging fruit exists, but it's optimistic because it means there is more room for improvement

##### Stripe is super written. We have pepople with headphones on right next to each other never talking

##### Either your company faisl very quickly or all your problems become about managing growth

##### Your time horizons increase linearly. after 1 yaer you think about 1 year. after 10 you think about the next 10

##### stripe eats 3 meals a day together

##### they copy each other on every outgoing email

##### gmail broke cause they copied too much (maybe need another program)

#### need for formal, explicit, broadcast communication
##### the bigger you are the more you need to have structure and consistancy vs speed

### denmark, signapore, costa rica, most happy places in world

### gross national happiness in bhutan is more polical smokescreen than actual effort

### why do successful capitalists believe material wealth is important to happiness? (this is obviously overdetermined, but what exactly is important)

### What's good about south korea [[How asia works]] why are the tigers good? land reform, protected but competitive export industries, tight control of consumer credit sector.
#### government funded car plant, but make it compete internationally

### robinson crusoe was first novel?

## [[AKC]] [[Mati Roy]] calls montreal mtl?

## [[Roam]] clean up all pages that have no text and no links (created by accident)

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] double click word selects space after. This is good for prose, but bad for converting words to links and for programming. Ideally it operates as word for [[, and operates as word+space for delete.

## #idea [[responsiveness first software]]. Make software that can be used with a wide range of hardware, that does all the core stuff first, then applies additional features later and may cancel those features if it's already spent too much time. It has a hard limit on how much time it can block for after each user input, and will then switch to asynchronous, then reduced features if it runs overtime. Use small icon in corner to show which features its running and which features its leaving out right now.
### I want this because I'd much rather my computer provided fewer features in times of heavy load than be unresponsive, but most programs implicitly favor features over responsiveness.

### For example, if it doesn't have time to index your content, it can show a little icon for "search index incomplete" instead of slowing your computer down while indexing.

### For example, right now I'm using [[Roam]] for pure txt. If my computer is swamped right now, I'd much rather Roam operate in txt mode than it take forever.

## Uber switch to myseql
### let's imagine it takes 4 hours to upgrade myseql. How do you do this with 0 down time?

### incrimentally update each node. for each one, keep a log of transactions that happen while its updating. After it updates, apply all those transactions, then its online.

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]]

## Why no comments in JSON?

## [[Replacing Guilt]] is primarily about managing subjective scope.
### sometimes you are scoped in too narrow. Sometimes you're scoped in too wide. Replacing Guilt is about noticing that and scoping in to the appropriate level

## [[Fermi Paradox]] https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kvZshdx5FzTPjyhxG/the-fermi-paradox-has-not-been-dissolved
### Christian apologist Tim McGrew, who estimates the prior probability of having the evidence we do pertaining to the resurrection of Jesus at less than 10^-40, on the basis of multiplying together supposedly independent probabilities of each of Jesus’ disciples separately experiencing a hallucination.
#### this is because these are not actually independent events. Treating correlated events as independent in multiplied probabilities causes errors according to exp of number of events.

## I think that #EA focuses too much on aquiring credentials and getting into organizations, and not enough on radical new projects or ways to influence large systems from the outside
