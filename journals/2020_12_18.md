## Wish I could use [[F#]] instead of [[C#]] for Unity! actually looks like a better Haskell!

## Fuck I'm late to the bandwagon on Unity stock! It's price rose from 68 to 160, likely because of Quest 2?

## I don't like menus. You should be able to build your options into whatever product you built

## So many fucking people are talking about how to distribute the vaccine, but no one's talking about how we would do better to just grow the pie instead.

## illenois organic chem best tutorial

## Unity switched from VS to VSCode!!!

## [[GraphVR]] 
### TODO contact [[CodeParade]] about using his hyperbolic renderer for graphs

### https://github.com/hawksley/hypVR

### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c52QhiXsmyI Want to use API inspired by clj REBL

### Minimal API
#### js ```javascript
type Node = {
  render: (point)=>void;
  id
  realize: ()=>[Node,[Node],[Edge]]
}
type Edge = {
  render: (point,point)=>void
  id
  realize: ()=>[Edge,[Node],[Edge]]
}```

#### C# libray ```javascript
```

#### How do people call in C#? ```c#
public class MyNode : Node
{
  public void expand(){
  
  }
}```

### TODO Can I go from a data structure to a game object? 

### TODO Should everything be driven by top-down data? it's not the Unity way, but it's so much better. 

### Using gitignore from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore

### If Unity was a perfect, functional world
#### user provides ```javascript
public class Node : MonoBehaviour{
  id
  public List<GameObject> getOutgoing();
  public List<GameObject> getIncoming();
  public List<GameObject> getAllEdges();
}
public class Edge : MonoBehaviour{
  id
  getEnd
  getStart
}```

#### I provide ```javascript
public class Node {
  public void followEdge(edgeId){
    
  }
  public void focusEdge(edgeId){
    
  }
}
public class Edge{
  public void focusStart()
  public void focusEnd()
}```

#### User 

#### [[TabNine]] just autocompleted `if(edg)` to `if (edges.containsKey(id))`. This is C#, I didn't even know what the 'contains' method was called!

### Could have edge and node datatypes that we encourange user to edit, pass those into a createNode function

### What does the consumer need to provide?

## Is the best usage pattern for tech "binary" (me pun?)? meaning either 100% using a computer interface, or 0%

## [[December 20th, 2020]] would a hybrid graphical programming language help people learn programming?
### [[Tao Quotes]] Terminal is good for writing. Bad for reading. Infographics, interactive demos good for reading. Combine them to get [[Hybrid Graphical Programming]]

### What is a [[Hybrid Graphical Programming]] language? A language usable with 100% keyboard, where at all times your options are visible and usable in a visual interface.

## [[VR]] the quest store probably has very stringent quality checks on performance. I'd guess they don't let anything with a normal framrate under 50 into the app store

## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMwqiAeQDUc
### This is awesome! It is essential to be able to learn muscle memory input, like typing, in VR. I don't think it will be revent this year, but definitely in a few years.

### The bridge?

### [[VR Programming]] I should make a general purpose graph explorer (API) for VR. This can be used to navigate files, social networks, code, ect... [[GraphVR]]

### it doesn't have rotate-windows-so-this-is-in-front

### Bridge concept is same as SideKick

## I don't like long travel keyboards because the force angle needs to line up. Normal laptop keyboards let you press at any angle and they still work.

## https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2020/02/it-felt-very-much-like-a-punishment-medical-leave-at-dartmouth [[Jeremy Hadfield]]

## Notify me when command finishes: `&& notif` `alias notif="zenity --info --text \"Command Finished\""`
### [[Improvements]] need to make it focus the terminal that just finished

## [[Week Challenge]] Laptop is better than phone. How about I don't use my phone (with the exception of scanning QR codes on something like WhatsApp) for a week?
### [[December 25th, 2020]] my phone is behind couch in mom's office. Hopefully I actually forget where it is an need to read this :)

## this is a bit hardcore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1HkFHl_u84

## It's so aweful that people can't really start programming with CLJS and Reagent. The stack is built on top of Java, CLJ, JS, and React. It might work, but the abyss below you would be too much.

## wtf default git branch is called main instead of master bc BLM

## [[Personal Website]]
### Reference
#### https://gwern.net

### why do people use fancy css animations?!?! Lesswrong books, stripe, lots of others use this and it's always glitchy (and just annoying)

### Content
#### Writing about myself has always been hard. It doesn't always have to be

## Need more programs that combine productivity of pro creation software & gameyness. For example, 

## Trying [[Calva]] 2.0.16 as per github
### startup message changed, still got either 'search' of undefined or 'no artifact nrepl'
