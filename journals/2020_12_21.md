## Is this keyboard faster? I think it actually is!!!! the other one had latency, and inconsistent latency at that!!!

## [[Graph Layout]]
### Cose: takes long time, is good for non-hierarchical graphs
#### Is there such a thing as discrete space force directed layout? dense grid of places for nodes, makes less nauseating, more predictable, more ergonomic.

### Dagre: is only good for things that are based on trees

### None of these, besides Dagre, are really what I want
#### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing

### What if you have lots of nodes same size, and render each one with a size according to the number of links between you and it instead of distance
#### more like its distance is exactly according to number of links

## [[Eric Weinstein]] particles are knots in space. everything is space.

## [[Jonathan Blow]] showed me new perspective. instead of "fast C code is ugle", I should think "how can I make the **execution** of the program simple?"

## Costs of making a business out of [[GraphVR]]
### buying headsets

### challenges of the business:
#### lack of VR headsets out there

#### Lack of good OS for VR

#### conflict between open source and money

## instead of working in abstract space like "class", "folder", work within an VR space [[GraphVR]] [[Pitch]]

## TODO [[January 21st, 2021]] Have share worthy demo of [[GraphVR]]

## I've officially grown out of graph layouts in [[Roam]]! Yay i'm part of club!
### ofc with my graph layout it will be piece of cake ;)

## [[AutoHotkey]] cares way too much about having short source. it doesn't even have built in run on startup! 100% of users want this, but they're like "we're just the essentials" bs.

## [[Favorite]] musician: [[Boy in Space]]

## If I could be any character from a fictional work, I would be [[Lady Third Kiritsugu]] from [[Three Worlds Collide]]. 
### What would I improve about [[Lady Third Kiritsugu]]? 
#### they should allow subcultures

### What would happen if [[Lady Third Kiritsugu]] somehow appeared by itself in my room?
#### It wouldn't be prepared to live in oxygen environment with this gravity. Would likely be able to adapt in a few minutes. wouldn't consider sparing stuff important. would just start eating something immediately, like my clothes. Would realize I'm sentient quickly. It wouldn't be able to speak or understand me in the first few minutes. would likely be able to record my speech and myscreen text almost immediately. 

#### Am I yummier than other stuff in my room? seems the ship can eat any matter. if an individua l has  the same reactor capabilities as ship, then will eat anyting. if it uses bio metabolism, then I would be better to eat. 

#### Would it be able to decode my brain and integrate my preferences by itself quickly? I really don't know. if it could, then it would just skip to that, just attack me and merge immediately. More likely it would not

#### There's a chance it would eat me immediately out of survival. may be actual best option.

## does using small keyboard kill my abilities with normal keyboard? seems like no!!!

## accidentally told mom about [[how to have good relationship with my parents]]. am having her read it. I will be able to see the effects if she reads it now. I won't if she reads it at some unknown time in the future.

## I have a somewhat more ergonomic desk setup now. straight arms, looking sraight ahead, not down.

## Bluetooth keyboard does have higher latency than my razer keyboard.

## [[Mini Keyboard]] This keyboard has smaller key placement than normal keyboard. didn't want that. would have gotten normal. however I'll ty this, because I do notice it's too hard to hit the fn keys, and I may get better performance on hard to reach keys, which is most important for me right now in order to operate efficiently programming in vr. Il'll try this for some duration, see if it works.

## So far my most common mistake is hitting delet instead of backspace.

### when I took a tiny bit of shrooms, I saw tesselation pattern kinda like this. no other tesselation pattern.

## wtf google I thought you had some code quality 

## [[C#]] I want to  change all `edge` to `node` and all `Edge` to `Node` all at once. is there a super efficient way of doing this?

## [[Priority]]

## empathy is essential to assymetric relationships. Unlike symmetric relationships, they don't allow the golden rule. you have to model them as seperate from you to benefit them. Your net impact on them has to be positive at all times.

## imagining about [[Liu Cixin]] hearing about the 14 dimensions of string theory for the first time and imagining 14 macroscopic dimensions slowly disappearing and squeezing you into 3 dimensions. if it happened like that, it would be a true (as opposed to ordinary) galaxy brain moment

### majority of stripe devs in bay area wants to leave bay area

### in a city of more than 2 million people, you can build a great software company

### He bought IndieHackers

### bay area has never been a less attractive place

### in other countries, everyone is excited to start companies in their home countries, where one or two decades ago they all came the US.

## Why do my fingers take so long to warm up ty typing!!? this is so bad! it's not just 5 minutes, it's like 20 minutes!

## [[GraphVR]] do I have a "looks like a nail" problem? I think it's actually a good thing. If there's a new tool, the world needs at least one person trying to apply it to everything and seeing what sticks

## [[GraphVR]] ways to visualize program

:END:
### File / class / namespace / module level
#### links from the file to the file that it imports

### function level
#### links from each function to functions it calls

### Trace level
#### show sequence of lines of code as path in graph. lines that are immediately next to each other are considered the same node. Layout the graph so the path is a straight line

### Dataflow level

## [[GraphVR]] [[VR Debugging]]
### show path between each p

## Windows caches the size of directories. Ubuntu doesn't. that makes it easier to graphify directory in windows than ubuntu.

## VRChat software has potential, but it lacks nice people in the main hub. Should I hang out there, talk to new people, be that person?

## TODO [[VR Programming]] try out YourKit. It has good data on program structure.

## I kinda thought the small projects I did in Unity were a waste of time. Now that I have something I actually want to make in Unity, [[GraphVR]], it turns out they were not!

## rn [[Oculus Link]] is worse than vrdesktop, but it's the only way to do dev!

## [[VR]][[GraphVR]] Putting the headset on in development is 10x more nausiating than using finished apps

### i can't believe the cognitive dissonance how do you believe that you're a ritious code style warrior and have code that's so bad while other people have code that's so good.

#### if you do a depth first traversal of your project to get it done, you'll fail.

#### You need enough breadth to inform your low level decisions before you make them

### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0uE_chSnV8 Jonathan blow operating system
#### OS with No installs!

#### all library code position independent. One library type.

#### complexity because duality between command line programs and library functions
##### if you use grep library, that's the same thing as calling grep function

#### drivers as we do it today should be eliminated

#### I sorta dispute the idea that there would be a $PATH
##### instead user has folder with links to executables
###### this isn't any better

#### ubuntu had 4500 executables

## Wow f2 renaming is super useful!!!!

## [[GraphVR]] [[Calculate Load Depths]]
### how far do you have to go from a node to get to an un-loaded node or edge

### algorithm: keep set of non-loaded nodes, breadth first search from those to get load depths

## Do I have stockholm syndrome about Unity? would it be better in the end to use raw library and opengl?

#### This is what I mean. I want to be able to layout an infinite tree such that the close things look big, far things look small, and every split is the same. Doesn't work in euclidean
