## My website [[graphminer.net]] went live today!!!

## Once the Roam API works, I will change [[graphminer.net]] to query blog posts from Roam. Then I will use something like [[graphminer.net blog post]][[Down]] (or Up if it's up) to denote blog posts. Then I just have to query for [graphminer.net blog post][Up], get children as markdown, markdown to hiccup, show. Maybe it'll have children as hiccup already? Can also show link to roam block.

## [[Otter.ai]] [[Recording]][[Otter.ai Roam Paste Extension]]
### Formats text pasted from Otter.ai to Roam like this:

### [[Speaker 1]]
#### I'm talking

#### Talking again

### [[Speaker 2]]
#### My turn!

### [[Speaker 1]]
#### Me again!

### [[Speaker 1]]
#### You get the idea

#### it looks like this

### [[Speaker 2]]
#### My turn!

### [[Speaker 1]]
#### Me again!

## [[Recording]] AKC and I talking about parents, feelings, personal growth
### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah. Oh.

#### So

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### like, I used to think that other people's problems that were caused by like their own incompetence. were like, I guess it's like, for some people, are you recording this?

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### for some people. Like, I understood the problems they had. Okay. And it was like, like, take for example, Cassie. Like, I sort of understood.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, we can go upstairs.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### No,

#### I keep having these like wrong theories about my past self.

#### Oh, maybe

#### it's about I didn't understand the differences between mean. Like when someone else reacted to something in different way that I would have. It's just like I know

#### it's it feels so much harder to name what I did wrong than to me what I do right now.

#### What do I do wrong? Yeah.

#### But like something that I think has helped me a lot is like realizing that other people's feelings are real, even if those people's feelings exist in a false universe. So like, for instance, if my mom believes that, like, germs on groceries are dangerous, then like she's still suffering because of that situation regardless where the germs exist and are not used to like, not empathize with that

#### suffering.

#### And now I can and that's, like, I think that might be like the main thing. Trump Oh, did

### [[AKC]]
#### you suffer because They believe that

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, yeah, like that suffering, you know, like, like, it gets deeper than that. Because like sometimes there's like performative stuff where like, sometimes, you know, people might appear to be suffering when they're actually not. Like, the thing with like mom and the groceries that's not suffering. Like, she's doing that because of like, more internal drives and external. But yeah, what's something like?

#### Well, yeah, like performative,

#### performative things are they're so complicated, because like, Yeah, sometimes someone will be like, like, act like they're having a really bad time just to get attention. And it's like, I really, I actually don't understand what it like, I understand what it feels like. I don't understand very well. what it feels like

#### to like,

#### do this. It's like believing something, because we're like, saying something that you don't actually.

#### Like, I don't.

#### Yeah, I don't understand those feelings very well. Like what I do now, if I see someone with feeling like that, is like, yeah, right now, I just tried to, like avoid, apparently minimize those as much as possible, just like change the subject.

#### But I do need to figure out what those view like from the inside in order to be able to like actually be.

### [[AKC]]
#### Like, germophobia?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### No, so I think germophobia is internal. Like, for instance, like, there must be like, being the food that you thought were bad. And then now things aren't bad, but we thought was good enough, or bad. So like, you can understand what it feels like, you know, if someone says like, Oh, I'm afraid of germs, like, you had experiences like that, where you are like, Oh, I'm afraid of this chemical. And then later, you're like, actually, no, I'm not afraid of that chemical. And like, you understand, oh, back then I was afraid of this thing. That wasn't bad.

#### But like, can you? Yes. Can you imagine what it feels like to like,

#### quote, believe that the election was rigged? And be sad about that? I can't imagine that very well.

### [[AKC]]
#### Can you imagine what it feels like to do that? Not really.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Like, I think, understand that is essential for like, having a useful interaction with people.

### [[AKC]]
#### Or you can chalk it up a term you could follow a friend Timothy two into on Facebook, you can interact in other terms.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### You don't

### [[AKC]]
#### have to interact with him have a politic? Yeah, Timothy two did yeah. Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, yeah. I'm saying like, you probably something useful that can use some useful interaction about politics that you could do, if you understand what that felt like. Yeah, yeah. You don't understand that?

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, like, I think

#### my parents, like this illusion was fundamentally acknowledging that, like, feelings that are caused by false beliefs are still real feelings.

### [[AKC]]
#### It's also more complicated when it comes to feelings caused by other false beliefs like a union. To PSU in order to be happy or you need, there are also other one, but can you get a B to get happy, happy, or you need to have another girlfriend Jeff app to be happy? Or if any, or at least have to have like scenes that are too dependent on other people to be choose to chew or bust?

#### Well,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### like.

### [[AKC]]
#### So

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### let's say that your, your mom says you need to get a girlfriend. Because it doesn't happen.

### [[AKC]]
#### Because your mom say that? No.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Like, I said that there are few different things going on.

### [[AKC]]
#### And I don't think it's I don't even know if that's the worst thing either, by the way?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I think it is.

#### Because I think one part of it is that like, the whole, like, the evolutionary point of being a mom, is to like, pass on your genes. And if your kid isn't gonna pass on your genes, you kind of failed as a mom from like, You're like a biological, your parents care.

#### Yeah, my parents didn't hear. Oh, they do. Holy crap. Not a combo. Okay, not. Not a thing is that they married relatively. We expect you to marry right now. Are

### [[AKC]]
#### we? Hell Really? Did

#### they marry?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### When my mom was?

#### I think my mom was like, 27 when I got there, that's late. Well, no. So they only met each other when they were like, 25 or something. It's not deadly. It's not late, but I'm saying like

#### your parents, you know, got married when when they weren't like, then when you're 20 they might have for you about getting married and having fun. Yeah. So if your parents are saying you need a girlfriend to be happy, part of it is them wanting grandchildren for themselves. So like, part of that is just like, their value system. And also like, their I guess like, norm Enos allows them to like semi lie about this? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, normally, they lie. But they, they don't they don't exactly know the origin. But they're blaming them question or? Well, I think what's more important, like the school distinction, like parents need to go to school. Let me homeschool myself.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, so like with the parent with like, a girlfriend or marrying thing, like part of it's that. And part of it is like,

#### like you tend to? Well, I guess that there's also like the arm

#### on what do you call it, like, there's a virtual stick for virtue signaling strategy, where if you say the stuff you already did is a good idea that makes you look good. So your parents married. And they kind of make them look bad to say that married a bad idea. Because that means that they did something bad. They're advised to stay married, it's good. And also, like, there are some real benefits, there are real happiness benefits to having a long term relationship. So it's like, a combination of lots of false things and true things. And it's a combination of like them caring about you, and then caring about themselves. It's just very complicated. And, like, a way that I might have, like, thought about this in the past is like, your belief is wrong, and I don't have to listen to it.

#### But like,

#### That only works if you can actually not listen to it. But you can't actually like, sometimes stop listening to what they're gonna say anyway. And like, if this is like, we've been saying it's gonna happen regardless of what whether you pay attention, or like, if they're, they feel bad because of this thing. Regardless whether you listen to it, then you want to actually stop it from happening. You want to stop stop them from like, Like feeling like you're doing the wrong thing, stop them feeling like they're failing at being a parent or something. And if you want to actually fix that, you can't think of it in terms of, like, you're wrong, I don't have to listen to you. You think of it, in terms of you are suffering because of, like, this variety of factors? And is there anything I can do to prevent that?

#### And like, if you make them and sometimes I credit, this improvement to like, like the signalling stuff

### [[AKC]]
#### I just mentioned,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I think that's a bit false, because I think the improvement happened like, like, just slightly before I actually read lots of psychology stuff. Actually, no, I don't know. That's the problem. I didn't record enough, like, I don't know, like, exactly.

#### Exactly how much the psychology stuff actually mattered at the time. Yeah.

#### Like the part about like, acknowledging these deep feelings based on false beliefs, like, on the one hand, I think that, like I have, my brain has just gotten better at this as I got older, out of my control. But also, I think if like, I made a conscious effort, I could have done it much earlier. So it's like, it's a combination of, like, uncontrollable and controllable factors that realize it.

#### Do you want a homework assignment?

### [[AKC]]
#### with homework assignment?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Is this a good idea? Or a bad idea?

### [[AKC]]
#### Okay. No, like

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### something that's really important. In like, your parents, oh, yeah, defying low cost things you can do that will satisfy them.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah. Yeah. What,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### what thing is, costs you the least her how much they reduce the relationship, your parents?

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### For me, some of these lowest cost things are like, like setting aside time to talk to them. Like, it turns out that something like, you know, an hour every week, or like, at some points, it was, you know, like 40 minutes every two weeks, really is not a big cost. But it can really help a lot. Things like telling my parents in advance before I do things. If you're, if you like, have reasonable time management, it really doesn't cost much to tell your parents things that they want to know about before they happen.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, yeah. Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Because, like for instance on one thing was my dad wanted to know when I would be at dinner.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, yeah. And like

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### it really depends, but I think Yep, like on 90% of days or more, you can just like know what, whether you're going to be there beforehand and just like share a calendar. Yeah, just let them know that cost very little, like, occasionally will be more expensive because you know, like, there'll be some urgency and like it'll be easy to forget but like just having the having like a calendar there on like, you know, 90% of days helps a lot. Mm hmm.

#### What do you think are some low cost things you could do that would improve your appearance?

### [[AKC]]
#### Um,

#### it's hard to say at this moment I mean, I think moving it being away from them helps a lot because of the way I tend to irritate them when I'm when I'm with them because they often complain the book versus when they complain about me staying in my room all the time. That's the worst I don't know why I call it a negative negative quality if I just stay in my room all the time. And I mean, that's literally it's like a good argument you move out and I mean, it and when it did move out to get given a lot of puzzle, Carly, I don't know why it's just so negative for me when I'm in my room at the time it just is.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Can you guess why?

### [[AKC]]
#### They think I'm like, I mean, it just feeds into stereotypes of me not not having exercise and just me being it could be a little computer all the time. It does if you're if you see your child being like computer all the time, it's sometimes like causes weird weird negative Kalia

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### weight

### [[AKC]]
#### also tend to make them more worried concerned about me if I'm at home and when I'm away. Like, they feel like they have to be doing something more for me whereas when I'm when I'm away, it's like they don't we don't feel that they don't feel the need or obligation. So really, it really was moving out and also diet stuff or like I used to be much much worse now it's better because now they finally get they hate fucking hate that I think it used to be we all had we all had we had this typical fight over race and I hated it. It's like your race. And though I found secret, I found secret ways just throw it away just to or pretend I was eating or I was like Corbin and girl over it. And just pretend Oh does Eat Eat halfway and then but now now now it's much better because leaving now they kind of understand the I mean, they tend to like read data tend to read a lot of bullshit tells and they're aimed. At least at last. It's like finally although push up people to Tulsi they're saying that low carb is better and rice a toxic and all that.

#### Movie.

#### Yeah.

#### But yeah, thankfully, that's not an issue.

#### Well,

#### so also, there were even issues of vegetables like the gets so annoying. Like they I don't care that much. Honestly, would they care? They care a lot more when they cook it. It's just, it's just a fucking best sleep they think you shouldn't. It's not just talking about what to do. They cut them in a particular way in a very extremely time intrusive. The diff had zero respect for time whatsoever. That's fine. But my parents they wait. I mean, they're not exactly productive people. They're not exactly. I mean, I don't like that. I think very highly of them, even though I feel like recognize that there. If you recognize that, yes, this is important for my lived experience. This is why I'm the way it is like why I was brought into the world. So I have to respect that and like future people are going to have more sympathy for me. They actually have some idea of how I was always I

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### actually

#### here's something about me. You could say I don't respect that my parents brought me into this role. I don't do that. Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't think that's really Uh huh.

#### Oh, yeah. One thing is with those bowls. Unfortunately, we only have five of them.

### [[AKC]]
#### Okay, and we use them

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### at dinner.

### [[AKC]]
#### Okay, so I should wash

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### them. Yeah. So they have to all be washed before dinner.

### [[AKC]]
#### Okay. Okay. So that's like, Okay, all right. Taco

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### is great.

### [[AKC]]
#### I just wash it anyway.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Chicken, salsa

#### tomatoes

### [[AKC]]
#### go to

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### my sweet

#### either back. We didn't

### [[AKC]]
#### holiday basket. Oh, cool

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### about respecting that they brought you into this world?

#### The thing is that like,

#### I don't know, like, if you

#### like you technically can tell they brought you into this world like evidence Yeah. But it's not something you like actually have to interact with. Whereas their feelings are something you have to interact with. And like, because of your psyche, like, like, because they were with you for so long, like, they relate your relationship with them and like, it's like, a deep part of yourself. So like, it's true that like, you are very psychologically bound to them, and they are psychologically bound to you. Like that's the binding that makes that actually has an impact. Not the binding of like, you came out of them. Yeah,

### [[AKC]]
#### yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.

#### I don't

#### Yeah. Like people don't really have that much distinction between adoptive and actual parents. It's time to think in terms of like,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### if you want to, like beliefs that are useful, will like help you be happier or help you do something. Yeah. Yeah. And like that psychological binding, like, is like a real part of the world. And you need to know about it to make decisions. Like, who you came out of, like, doesn't like, I guess it helps you like, you know, when you're looking at your DNA results, but like, other than that doesn't really help.

#### And like that, that's one thing that I think is very powerful. Like, you're not a robot, like, there's no like, fundamental obligation for you to make your parents happy.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, there isn't.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### But what you do have is this psychological binding, which means that, like, your relationship with your parents is high leverage.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's actually important.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### And it's Yeah, it's that leverage that attaches you to them, not like some sort of responsibility.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I'm like, you think about it in terms of leverage, like it's your power to do this.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, yeah, like paints good scenes what happened and and who for guessing happened if I interrupted I think was this My mom is that she also have a tendency for fulfilling makes like interacting with her. Like she's often paid I don't know why but like even teach me something she gets impatient and angry and irritated easily, which also causes aversive reaction. And it's not just the first reaction versus reacting towards anything similar to it. So before then like, it gets preferred, she gets into other people because because she like, she also like she looks like a completionist. Like, bias to or like, I don't know, if you start you have to finish yourself something like that. And that also like caught? No, that also cause a lot of tension too. So like, yeah, then that makes you like, not want to start at all.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, so

#### like,

### [[AKC]]
#### so yeah, that's like also like, Why just moving away from them to improve things immensely. Of course, I'm not the only one who fades. Who, whose extension. I think you're, you're, you're fine enough. But

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### it's also for me, I moved away. And so like, I've actually only lived away from my parents for like, one year.

#### Yeah. So you haven't tried it in like, nope. But that you was very important for me? Oh, yeah.

#### I think if I just lived my parents the whole time, you'll be worse. Yeah. But like,

### [[AKC]]
#### but you have Zenith you, you have the you, you you know that something else is possible. You have he basically know that. That's it, you know that it's possible. And so if he was like it is too much, it's too much for you, you know that you know that you can't get to another you get he can't get away to another another another place where we're in, since we'd like improve a lot. If, if there ever if tensions did boil over? Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, like. So like, why does? Why is your model completionist?

### [[AKC]]
#### I don't know. I don't think you really analyze it. And you'll think and I'll think if she really, like had some motivation or drive to really analyze this. Well, like, she didn't recognize it actually, like she faced in retrospect, he wish he didn't yell at me when she was trying to help me with homework or mass or whatever. She wish she didn't try to yell at me. But the thing is, when when he does try to help, when she does when she does try to do it, it happens anyways. And then like, I don't know why she oftentimes provides technical support or something, I can sometimes see the irritation in her voice whenever he's dealing. I like helping others with technical support on her working anyways. And it's like, God, Damn, this is just like too much.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Like,

#### like, I feel like I can't empathize with someone who's completionist like, you can't, like I'm not personally Yeah, I'm biased more towards exploration. Yeah. But like, you know, you've heard of the exploration, exploitation.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, I know that.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### In like, in pretty much all animals, there's like a baked eating preference. There's, like baked in algorithms for exploration versus exploitation. Like people's curiosity naturally declines as they get older, like, the cat, like the cats become less curious naturally as they get older. So like, everybody has this, like, trade off built into them. And some people just have it built in so calibrated differently. Like, some people like you or me, you know, explore more and like that biologicals, which that makes you switch from exploration, exploitation, just like, doesn't turn on. But it's in some people it does, and like,

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, I'm actually trauma type of exploitation.

#### Well, you mean,

#### we're talking about you know, yeah, yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. Yeah. In terms of like, note slave driving yourself.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah. Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### But like, do you think that having some people who care a lot about like, complain about like, finishing things is good for the world? Yes, I agree. Yeah. Like, it's good for a society of some people. Yeah, yeah. exploration. exploitation. So like, because of that, like,

### [[AKC]]
#### yeah, I can empathize with that. You know, that's just

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### how she operates. Like, just like, you know, I enjoy learning new things. She enjoys finishing things

#### and like, So what I would say is like, if you want to, like, come to terms with her on this, like, find something you actually do want to finish, and then like, involve her in

### [[AKC]]
#### that. There's gonna be fair, I did talk with some girls, and it's like my mom 50 jen actually doesn't really worry that much about me email. Yeah. I mean, they usually put more pressure on me to they usually put more pressure on me, but now it's like, I don't know, it's sometimes they just kind of forget that we're talking. It's been long, longer for you. Yeah, yeah. And I'm away even on the income find, like, I know how to invest.

#### Really did talk to me about getting a house or something like that. But I'm like, my money isn't high enough for that. Like there's, there's like, there's still like a huge range, because in order to actually have enough money to afford a house, actually, you know, they were looking at how many they actually were looking at with their houses. But even even in western itself like that. I mean, you still need at least 200 k in order to actually get the house. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I mean, they also like looking at the housing see out in the Seattle area, but now I've looked at I've looked at Zillow and like, Wister is actually much cheaper per square per square, a per square foot and Western and actually Western it's nice because it's closer to Boston. Be it's cheaper. See, it's it's relatively cold, and I cannot stand the heat at all whatsoever like it. Even even Colorado low heat drive drives me crazy as fuck. And I just like the summer was depressing. Do you have air AC here, by the way do you do to date do the house prebuild with AC?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### This house is pretty low AC.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, holy shit. Nice. Yeah, a lot of Boston. Everyone's aren't. Um, yeah, um, yeah. Yeah. There are places that are actually much cheaper, cheaper cost of living like, yeah, I mean, the Midwest is another places that cheap. That's cheap cost of living. But the problem is, if you don't, you're not next to an intellectual hub.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So like, you're saying that Wooster is cheaper than like, an equivalent distance from Seattle.

### [[AKC]]
#### I've actually looked at price per square foot. And like, I mean, fiallo would be easier for them since we get close, which isn't like looking to play like Lynwood. But even then, it's like not negligible. And I mean, give everything else equal. It's better to be somewhere that's an intellectual side center. I'm also like, I also don't worry what you will see is the Cascadia is closest Cascadia fault. And that actually makes me a bit concerned.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Wait, so is this a fault? Are you afraid of like a huge earthquake?

### [[AKC]]
#### Yes. predicted to happen? Yes. Yes. There. It's gonna happen in Seattle. In the next few decades alone might not Who knows?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### And like, Okay, how bad would this earthquake be when

### [[AKC]]
#### it happens? 9.0 magnetic? Oh, wipeouts in West Coast, we're sure but I mean, Seattle, we it will wipe out like the marshy land. Really this? Yeah, like South Lake Union might be might be tough because building my info from the east side it will so it will fare better. Um Yeah, I mean, Western is also a pretty fucking disaster proof. It's not the most but I mean, the worst. It's like you have wind storms. The wind service. Yeah. Oh, we're like northeaster is, um, but

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### the worst disaster has happened. Here was the ice storm in 2008. Ice Storm.

### [[AKC]]
#### No, okay.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### It was like, they were just like,

### [[AKC]]
#### okay, okay. Okay,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### and they like like, basically that's it. Lots of trees fell down just

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, yeah. No has that too. Yeah, that's a great great windstorm of Christmas Eve went to 5767

#### but the home prices are actually going up you're pretty faster than the national average in Worcester. Yeah. Okay. That's not that's not attract Ashley price isn't like Hartford in New Haven. Not surprisingly for

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### most of Hartford is that like when you're driving? Yeah, well, like know that this like concrete.

### [[AKC]]
#### Hi. Have you ever visit New York City?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### very occasionally. I

### [[AKC]]
#### don't. Okay. They just have they just announced new spirit flights between Boston and New York that are like $30
