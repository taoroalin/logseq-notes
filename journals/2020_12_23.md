## [[Recording]] akc transformer
### [[AKC]]
#### is like it's a transformation from. It is basically a transformation from one year and effort to another, we're not doing that. It's like a third of the transformation matrix is a way to get from one makerspace to another vector space or no one wants to based on representations from another set of representations and and then it's like a way to basically translate meaning, oftentimes in a, in a way that's topological, but ideally a lot but even the basic. The, the height. The large scale of topology geometry that preserves elements of topology geometry or mean, when the more important structural elements of the topology.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### When

### [[AKC]]
#### from one space of meanings or means pictures representation through those spaces mean, mean pictures representations. Hmm.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Okay. So you said like it transforms one vector space into a different vector space Yeah, a feed forward neural network or a like linear regression both transformer one vector space and all vectors

### [[AKC]]
#### transformations.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So what's the difference between one of those and a transformer,

### [[AKC]]
#### the transformer is more complicated is is a more general form that applies if you apply it to semantic one semantic space, he entered was medic phase, after semantic space.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Hmm. Yeah. So like, there's a difference in what information the it cares about the feed girl. What, like the feed forward neural network cares about like the absolute position in the space.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh feed forward. feed will feed for that athletes position.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, so that's one way of looking at it. If you know feed forward neural network. Like it maps, each point in the, in the, strictly vector space to different point in the vector space, yeah the vector transformation was,

### [[AKC]]
#### you have like, you can transform images, I mean one, one for me transformer is when you train with, you know, those scenes that transform your face into a fetal opposite gender, or a face of a different age or race,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### okay well those are convolution alone networks. Yeah, but

### [[AKC]]
#### I know. I mean, do you have a key valid query in that.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Let me, there's no, there's no key value or query well okay in style transfer. Okay.

### [[AKC]]
#### TV CNN.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, there are no Transformers in style transfer.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, very, I think, yeah, I

#### mean content transfer knowledge from one brain to another you have keys

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### values and so like, I think you're talking about something more general, like, I guess, maybe that's maybe like what you're talking about is what that article was talking about, well, most of the time transformer means this like specific equation, which, like is a form of general transformation, but, like, yeah, they're talking about a very specific thing not just like generally transforming something.

### [[AKC]]
#### I know, we're going to arrive Monday, but they got delayed and who knows when they arrive here now.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Okay. What we can send them to you. Yeah. Yeah. But like what's the difference between transformer and things like a CNN or R, or like the difference between a transformer and all the other neural network architectures.

### [[AKC]]
#### I think will transfer to a non local, they may be they allow for distributed attention, which allows you to transform, which allows better, better characterization of South attention of his winning map as the basis for universal universal attention. Since we map a space of say up to look. Take us salesman has an entire book. So, each, so it's like he for me an offer then you offer like half each meaning each word each word is mapped to, you have to like train the word across the word word if use across across entire corpus of text another setting, so that you can figure out the context it's like a context, it has a context vector ascribed to it.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah.

#### Yeah, that's good.

### [[AKC]]
#### It transcript, a transformer is basically more context sensitive, where at where context is like, but where, where were Where did where is it. Where does map to paths that have a certain context. Rather, rather than just decimos that the word. Most of the police around that particular word. Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, like in a transformer. The words influence each other based on their position, and their similarity, not just one or the other.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh yeah, their position familiar, not efficient.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. And like, you can also have a system where, where words are just connected based on semantics, but not position. Okay, but those aren't suitable for things like language.

### [[AKC]]
#### When we definitely have like translation, which case you like translate one word, one word to another. Our army substitution effects, so yes. Do you also have ambiguity attitude intense. Also like there is. Were there just traders that are not very easily substitutable or just creative where I think like reference reference or antecedence. Also like this at Sephora versus Anna flora. And like transformers are more respectful of like, so far, whereas some attention is halogen assessor anyways yeah also like sometimes distant feature in the hidden topology like it we transform a circle shaped object to a square like object or. or more, more, more precisely, give me a square to some central hyper hyperbolic geometry hyperbolic geometry is some, some scene where, where seams that are close to each other. And that, in that are closely locally close to each other, might might actually be distance when transformed to divert to geometry where, where if you more, such as a few more x axes much more even more four axes. Hmm.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I haven't thought very

#### much about, like, different geometries and neural networks.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh yeah hyperbolic. Yeah. And listen, if you aren't too hyperbolic backwards. But just become a person that you can get to reach out to. He's also in Boston for now.

#### He's involved with a machine learning. Education Group in the Boston area.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well yeah like you can a hyperbolic activation function, but it's much harder to have an actually hyperbolic neural network is you could have like a, like a hyperbolic attention layer where the distance is calculated in hyperbolic space

### [[AKC]]
#### offload temporary, there are some people theories on like how the brain map desk houses do map in the brain and like, it's very very non obvious because oftentimes, two different concepts are just like in totally different pieces of brain and although you have neuronal connectivity is such that we can even activate representations of the brain is decreased activation were brought up versus near sensing that some cops were activated, very diffusely whereas other other concepts are just very, very closely activated like. Now turkeys are composed of weird semantic associate. I mean, weird associations, such as if you remind your first crush, if that's the the act of it as a lot, a lot of weird definitions can be composed of it's like your first crush while at the war.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### They

### [[AKC]]
#### also dislike feedback that come out of a group of people you might be high surprise diverse stories. Yeah. Emotional associations, But then even that high emotional component, it might be highly connected nodes or whatever.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Wait a minute. For me the name, Gabriel is bad. I think there was someone I didn't like called Gabriel. But. Me too, but I can't remember this, like, I can't remember anything about this person like Do they even. I remember feeling like the name Gabriel is bad because it was a bad person with that name. I don't remember anything about this person Oh

### [[AKC]]
#### yeah, you know, oh yeah, like Barbara's name,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Chloe that's, like, that's like a relatively trivial thing and comparison. Yes.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah, that's a common theme, and then there are other names where you might associate that with being ugly or fat or

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### it will like, like, like old people's names are because like names go in trends, yeah like their time

### [[AKC]]
#### isn't even a factor in chewy what I do a bad person.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Heidi.

### [[AKC]]
#### Yeah.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I am making that one, Heidi Oh, she was a person who we met right where I think we talked this article Heidi in Vancouver. Oh okay, what's her name Heidi. No no no no it wasn't it. Yeah.

### [[AKC]]
#### Oh, you were in Chicago. That was what y'all think was your major.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Oh yeah, I said that I don't know my, what I say I'm interested in changes. Yeah right now. Like, I think I could become very interested in cognitive science, but it's like the barrier to entry seems like higher and like not worth it,

### [[AKC]]
#### I guess. It's also fairly higher. But I think it's like less. So I was like more distributed representation of things. So, if I mean, you hear me, Marvin Minsky the value of money he read his essays, it's like they're talking to this bias.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, I don't know what. Where's the next color science. Where's the next like neuroscience breakthrough gonna come from

### [[AKC]]
#### breakthrough Camelia Institute, or.

#### I mean,

#### if not I can see in my eye, but I mean one of what I mean cognitivism is one area i mean it's it's easier to to be cognitive deconstructive signals in the brain than those that are coming up with an atom or with some papers, but like,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### what, what our research is this justice or Institute doing

### [[AKC]]
#### genelia Oh really, I mean it's trying to map signals to attract it better, better higher resolution visual signal properly so like if you read a graph in Europe. Basically, you'll be able to completely read out, man, feel as more. This is just like you can read with him, whether gratis D, you can map has loaded rapidly in based on his brain activity or whatever.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### That does sound good. Yeah. Oh, Wait.

## [[Recording]] [[November 17th, 2019]] mom
### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Hi. Hi. I'm

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### sorry about that part, I had to move the car to a different spot. So I could talk. Cool.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So he had enough friends over that there wasn't enough parking in front of his house.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### See, again, I can't create

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Austin had enough friends over that there wasn't any parking on his Street.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, well, there's like to ask me about that cuz like, like most of the houses on the street have like no parking towaway zone signs. And so I and I was planning to leave I did leave the car for Father's Day. So I wasn't really sure what I could get away with on history. And and the parking spaces, you know, right around is out there. Yeah, very confusing to me about parking. Like, like, there's a lot of signs that say, parking, to our policy, to our parking. Except Sundays, or something like that. Like, I never really know how to interpret these things. Does that mean I'm Sunday? The parking lot? If

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### you want, you can? Yeah, no, I I think that probably means on Sundays, you can park as long as you want. I would think so. I think so. Yeah. Does it say like parking is restricted for to two hours, except on Sundays? Is that the wording? Or part? Like it? Maybe the wording matters? Like, do they say parking is allowed or two hours or parking is restricted to two hours? Who, who even cares? It's irrelevant. I

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### know. It's like two. I mean, it can't fit that many words on the sign. That's part of the problem. That's why so like clear. I think it's like, two hour parking. Except Sundays or something.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. Yeah.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Anyway, um, so what were you thinking about utilities, I couldn't quite follow it, because it was sort of dropping in and out.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So utility companies are companies that invest a lot of money in each customer. And for which each new competing business has to basically pay all the costs of ever having that business. It's the very beginning. So in it when people like in terms of like, things like providing water pipes to your house, a lot of the cost of providing water is in building the pipes to your house. And only one company gets to do that when your house is built. And each come any company that wants to compete with the original company has to spend pretty much all the resources that they're access are ever going to have to spend on you, immediately before you ever get to try their product. So you can't like, like, with most things, you can like, buy a different brand of cereal one day and see if you like it. Whereas you can't do that with utilities, one utility, invest a lot of money in you as a customer. And you can't try anybody else until that company has invested just as much in you as a company that you're already with. And that really inhibits competition between companies and competition. So yeah, keep going.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Well, I mean, finish your time.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Please interrupt.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I guess I don't think so. I mean, I mean, another way to look at it is basically the customer's satisfaction is irrelevant. Because yes, they've already paid the money. So the only issue is like, how much of it I use and whether I'll cut down or not on my use of it and pay them less

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### or something. Yeah. Yeah, so that basically means that utility so like utility companies tend to be heavily regulated. And and that's partly because of this week. That's because of this. Yeah, because a free market in utilities. leads to extreme ripoff. Yeah, and actually general like a lot of yours. incumbent European countries have completely nationalized utilities for some things like water, where there is no company that gives you water, the government provides water. And that is actually even better, then regulated companies for some things. Wait San, again, he started leaning in that in some countries like in Europe, there is no water company that provides the water, the government provides the water pipes for everyone. Because, yeah, really, realistically, you're not going to get waterpipe from two different companies. So you pretty much have to have one organization that does everything with regards to that utility for everyone. And this, the government does that. And generally, yeah, that is a better deal for people in countries that executed well, then having companies that are regulated, because the companies will always try to find loopholes in the regulation, because there are just interested in profit. And right, yeah, you can never have regulations so tight that they forced, like if you have regulations, so like, if the problem is really simple, like with water, there's very little possible innovation. And like, in a case where how, like, it's pretty obvious how to do the thing the company is doing. The only benefit of having the company there in the first place is just like for them to make profit, nobody else really benefit, because the government knows how to make waterpipes, just as well as the company has.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Of course, right? Of course, lately, there's been some humongous scandal about water bikes, like the whole also thing.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. Although, like, the way that European countries do, it is sort of better, because because their systems are national in the first place, instead of based on regulations. They also take more agency, like, in the US, we have regulations that say the water must be tested, like so and so. So in the US, the code says, You must, you know, the water must be tested by a professional every x years. Whereas it's the better way to do it, is to have people who is to have a better paid government, people whose job is to try is more open ended and is to try to improve the water quality of the of the people, instead of instead of having people who just need to meet this minimum requirement. Which Emily? Yeah, like, a lot of the problem is that these people just like, find loopholes. They're like, Well, you know, this can take like, we take lots of samples, like the average is slightly below the threshold, and we can ignore it and like close to this loophole stuff.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### So actually, in the US, it's kind of weird that I don't know this, but like, so it is. run by the government, isn't it water service?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I think I think it is, yeah, it's quite appeases sort of things not everyone seen a lot yet. Not as it's a much worse system than what Europe has.

#### Yeah, and so like, different industries have, like our utilities to different degrees, like the I think the part of the reason why the phone system is quite lacking is that it was the whole system was designed by at&t, and back then. There was no competition. And at&t had complete control over how the system works. And they invented it back then. And as time has gone on, there have been lots of different companies that have all contributed that have all like, made cell phone stuff. So it's now it's a little bit less of the utility, but the system that controls how phones operate, which is what like, lets phones know when they connect the system that tells phones like how to ask for a call and stuff like that doesn't get fixed because it doesn't give any of the because there's already complete market coverage and improving that system and help All the companies equally. So like your phone wasn't giving very good error messages. And that was because like the fundamental protocols of cell phone service are pretty bad. But improving those protocols would not get anybody wouldn't get any additional customers because everybody already has a phone. You can't get new customers by that. And it doesn't give any particular company an advantage over any other company to fix it. So, awareness.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Right, right. It makes total sense. Yeah, you're so stupid.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, economics is difficult. There's a lot of, yeah, it's very difficult to get these things. Right.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Right. So how are you?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I'm good.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### How is everything at school?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Um, so I, I think that I took I did the first test on which I did poorly on earlier, which was my English test. And yeah, so that was not very good. But overall stuff is going quite well.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Okay.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. So like, I've been able to work on my projects a lot more. I'm hanging out with friends actually a lot, like maybe even two months. Like, I definitely felt like that just now like this now, and I like I went to lunch with Nikolai and I was like, You know what, I really should be alone right now. I'm going to hang out with my friends too much, which is definitely a different problem than I had before. Which is good. Yeah. Um,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### so yeah, so like, Who are your friends?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### My friends. They are Nikolai and J, and a cos. And Ryan, those are my main friends out say,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Okay.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. So basically, it's like, and there are some other like peripheral friends were so like, I stayed. I was with my friends until midnight. Yesterday, and the day before that. And the first day, I was playing pool and then playing cards to get humanity, which is a fun card game. And then again, yesterday, I spent way too much money and went to a National Hockey League game is my friend. Oh, seriously? Yeah. All right. Yeah.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I can see how this spending trend here.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Although sometimes they like to What

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### does at least sometimes they like to play pool or do things like that that are not

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### expensive? Yeah, I'm so going to hockey I justify it by saying like, you know, it's not a Canadian thing. I should probably do it once but I'm not going to do another hockey game. Oh, yeah. Did

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### you not enjoy it? I enjoyed it not enjoy it worth the money got.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### It takes so much time. And it Yeah, it's not worth it. Yeah, I think actually your money and time are not worth it.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah. Actually, I like your reasoning now. Actually. I think there is something to be said that for that actually reminds me of when I was at Colgate University. The hockey games were like a really big deal. You know, it's like so it's definitely like a phenomenon that I needed to experience you know, yeah, but But yeah, I didn't really enjoy it a lot.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, hockey is more fun to watch than your average sport.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, that's probably true on didn't wasn't where they beat each other up.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Not not particularly bit. It was I would say it was not one of the more aggressive games so like in the National Hockey League, some games get into like big brawls and I think this was like a below average, violent, violent game. You know, like it still has the regular hockey violence of like smashing into each other. And have it didn't have like, like repeated smashing into each other or punching each other things.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### And your friends you get the feeling this is like a thing for them. They go to a lot of hockey games

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### are big fans. They go to some hockey games. Yeah, they go to hockey games, maybe like every other month, something like that.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### All right, all right.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. Although I think so, I think I am much better about spending now. Because, um, I just get a lot of stuff that I need. Like, I just, I feel like right now, I'm not actually handling my money very badly. Cuz I'm getting reasonable stuff at the cafeteria like, unlike last week, I don't know if I use any money outside of UBC. So I think last week, I only spent UVC card money on like food and didn't buy anything. So like, you know, that's a good sign. Yeah. What?

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### So tell me about that. So you do you actually have to pay for like individual dishes as a capture?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, yeah, yes, basically, you do. Huh? What's interesting,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I kind of didn't expect that I expected it to be sort of like it's at UMass. And in the colleges I went to it was sort of just all inclusive.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So I actually, I sort of like, this way a bit better, because it lines the costs up much more directly to the actual products, because like, realistically, some people bought some people use a lot more cafeteria food than others. And I think that people should have to pay proportional to what they use. So like, yeah, I think, you know, I should be paying more than someone as someone who like, you know, needs a lot of calories and eats three times a day at the cafeteria, I should be paying more than someone who only eats twice a day and doesn't burn as many calories. You

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### know, I guess I guess the one thing that I've that kind of like, like, neuron that fires in my money brain is like, you know, sometimes the healthier food is more expensive than less healthy options, you know. So I actually think that

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### at this cafeteria, for some reason, that's not really the case. I say, yeah, it may may. This may be at the school level, but it may also be at the country level that certain things are taxed more. But yeah, generally, that's not the case, actually, like, fruit is very good calories per spending at UBC.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Uh, huh. Okay.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. So yeah, that's not a problem.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Oh, that's good. Yeah. So you just get what you want. And, and it works out? Yeah. And like, I

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### definitely haven't. I haven't been controlling costs too heavily on cafeteria food. Like, I, I definitely could be cutting spending by around. Okay. Fun thinking about it. I think like, without unreasonable sacrifice, we if I ate at the cafeteria, I probably could be saving about 10% or 20%. But definitely, like, No, I'm not spending more than that over the minimal I could get by with at the cafeteria, although, like, yeah, in the cafeteria plan is required. So you actually have to spend a minimum of a certain amount over your, over your time at UBC. So like, I think it I would be better if I bought more food and like, you know, prepared my own stuff a bit more. But um, yeah, I don't know. That's a sort of project that I haven't started and probably won't start very soon. Just because yeah, it's like, a lot of stuff to think about. I have so I'm busy. Yeah, yeah, I

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### wouldn't I wouldn't even bother me. I don't know what your situation is. But I didn't bother. Definitely say well,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I might bother. I think I might do it after winter break.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah. Do some people do a lot of people do that.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Cook I'm not cook their own food. But like, I don't have a mini fridge I don't. I basically don't have any food in my room. And you can cut costs significantly by like, eating your own cereal for breakfast and eating sandwiches for lunch. You make that sort of thing but no, I, I wouldn't be cooking.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. Make sense. So how how far do you have to go to get to a place where you can buy that sort of buy groceries?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, there's a place that about a five minute bike ride or less a very short bike ride, but that's not the cheapest place and the cheapest place. Well, not the cheapest, but the best place to buy groceries. It was about a 20 minute bus ride away. Okay, but I but like my friends go there quite often so I can go there as a social outing, which really reduces the cost of it.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I see Yeah, yeah. The time cost

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### to Yeah, yeah. That's cool.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I'm so I'm so how's the winter break planning going?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I actually Well, for some reason, the flight base basically, I sort of was going to go from like the 2015, like a 20th to the 31st. But then you sent that email from Luna that said that she was going to be there from the first to assist. So basically, I I'm probably going to buy that I need to buy the tickets like today, and my duration will be probably actually I like to go back to the entire time like 20th

## [[Recording]] [[November 21st, 2019]] mom
### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Hi. Hey. How are you? Good. I'm doing good. Good.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Good. We're gonna miss you at Thanksgiving. Ah, are you? What are you doing Thursday?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Let's see.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Between two and five our times.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I'm 11. Three. So, I guess between three and five your time I'm completely open in between five and six. I mean, in between two and three. I am possibly open. Yeah, so open. Yeah. All right. Good.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### We're gonna have a Thanksgiving thing. So me and Jackie and Jackie Ruby,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### and stuff.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### So people are going to have Thanksgiving together. So maybe we'll give you a call.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### You Yeah.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, so what's going on over there?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Oh, pretty good stuff in general. Mm hmm. Yeah. Like what? Like. So, yesterday, what I really was a sort of uneventful, but milestone ish. On the day, because I went on a date. That was very good, actually. Really? Yeah. This is this person. I met philosophy class. Pretty cool. If I see okay. Yeah. But other than that, there's like, no, stop stuff is just doing relatively well. I just gave my grade calculations yesterday. Because at UBC we have a lot of time to study for our final exams, when there are no classes. And okay, I have calculated what I have to get in the finals in every class get an A, and I was surprised how low the bar is. So I thought I thought I was gonna have to kill myself over there, but it's not strictly necessary. Sounds nice.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Wow, that sounds like a good situation to be in.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah. Basically, um, I think, yeah, at this point, I am quite settled. It's kind of nice. I have most things that I need. Really?

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Does it feel

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### like home?

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Like you don't have that feeling like you're away from home as much

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### on that's fine. I think I do feel more at home. But I don't like feeling at home. I sort of Wish I felt not at home.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### It explained that way. That's interesting. Why do you Well, you like you don't want to feel like you're home.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Well, I sometimes feel guilty for not doing enough. And when I don't feel like I'm at home, I'm more motivated to do more stuff.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Really, so I find that for being comfortable. Like if you're comfortable then you kind of

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, driven. Yeah. So I don't know exactly what to do to that. The whole

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### endocrine system thing That, you know, like, I guess you're most productive if you're like, kind of like highly stressed and all the time and kind of aroused, like in a state of arousal all the time, but it's not really good for you in the long, it's not like sustainable or good for you, you know, to be always, always sort of highly aroused. You know, what I mean? Like,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### yeah, stressed and productive and and all that. Well, um, there's something to be said for shifting more of the stress earlier in your life. Because your accomplishments earlier in life will have larger effect in the long run. So if you have a certain amount of on stressing to you and non stressing better yet the stressing done first and the non stressing later

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I guess I guess there's something to be said for that.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So I feel like I actually should be a bit more stressed, then ideal right now, because by actions now will have a bigger impact. So yeah, I know that that's a problem. I guess, one way I heard this was Bill Gates was giving a talk. And he was saying, he was admitting that he had a completely unbalanced life for like, maybe two decades. And he was like, I really suffered, but it was totally worth it.

#### And now he's fine and happy and not killing himself all the time. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's how I feel.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Hey, do you buy your ticket yet to come?

### [[Tao Lin]]

### I can tell you the date. Yeah. Oh, yay. So I got it's a longer duration than I thought it would be just because that's cheaper. On I arrived, the 18th at 5:30pm. And I leave the third at 5:40am. So okay, leaving is very early. But yeah, it's a long time. Nice. Very nice.
#### 

#### Yeah. Do you like can you send us your itinerary just like them? Like, it's like so that way we'll have like your flight number for flight gets delayed. Well, you know, we could find that out and stuff like that. I don't have my bookie right here. But um,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### but this is exciting.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Was it probably coming on like a Wednesday? Right? For the Wednesday? What airline

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### delta

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### delta. Okay. So we're doing good here. Yeah, things are good. Let's see, I'm Uh, I'm kind of organizing this Thanksgiving

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### thing, which is different than usual.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### conditionally mom and dad, like host it, but they're leaving.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So, yeah, they're going to Santa Fe.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, yeah. So Jackie and I are

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Thanksgiving. So that's been kind of what's been on my mind, right. What's the location of this Thanksgiving thing? So

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### five Maplewood drive.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Okay. Yeah. Um, but yeah, it is more distance.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### People and also as I get At the time when it seemed like it was time to make a decision. Bora Bora was like living in, you know, the living room of our house. So because she's recovering from the surgery, and we didn't really know how long she want to be there and so it seemed like in her

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### head bedrooms. Yeah.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### So, like having the having the party like so that it's not like in our house actually peed an aura kind of is really that excited about this? Like when moms like both of them were like, fine. We'd like not celebrating Thanksgiving at all was kind of my

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### we were fine. Like Laura and Pete.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### So neither of them really was that excited about hosting Thanksgiving because they didn't really care that much inside it was like Apple so so yeah, honestly, I'm,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I'm the same as them. I don't really appreciate Thanksgiving too much, you know?

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Ah, yeah, I was not willing to not do it. Or I was I mean, I guess I might have to not do it. But I was kind of definitely wanted to do what I felt like. You Yeah, actually Hunter. Like, so Jackie is gonna, she's kind of helping me host it. But she said Hunter is not coming. We have not committed to come. Nor is Ethan. And Ethan is out of town. Yeah. At least around Oh, he is around.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### It's only a matter.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I don't know that much. I guess we'll probably know more after Thanksgiving. But um, I think he went to New Orleans with somebody who he knows from maybe who is from his high school or something like that. And I think that that trip was meant to be kind of shorter term like he was. So he stayed for maybe two weeks or something. Would you like, drove down and drove back. And so it's it's kind of laggy and he is planning to go back? Oh, I also know that he's working on a guitar. He's building a guitar with weidu. Which is pretty wild. Like he's been going over there like regularly to, you know, to get help building this guitar and in the workshop. Yeah, and he has a plan to go back to New Orleans. I don't know that many details of it, but not yet. All right. That as much as I know. Yeah.

#### And

#### I think but also Ruby, I have some plans to go hiking with Ruby, and to go orienteering be as Jackie, and possibly a friend from here.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### That'd be cool.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, I had a funny experience that orienteering was, like, I'd been going orienteering by myself and kind of wishing I could go as friends. And last weekend was sort of the nearest one, like these events are sort of all over the place. And, but there was one sort of near us, near Worcester,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### last weekend. So I

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### put out an invitation to kind of my mom's group. I'm actually used I used the mailing list from the Yankee swap, which is this party we have three like February.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### there were a few names I didn't recognize on there. But I figured, you know, there's like friends of my friends, so that should be fine. So one such person came, who I didn't really know and Claire Brayton and Kathy Treuhand and right and this person names

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### and

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### my friend actually, like Archons, a lot about competence, like, clearly like, it's definitely not ideal to go with like beginners, going like on a difficult kind of a intermediate level course. With beginners,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### in the cold,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### it was a difficult combination because you kind of don't want to stand around. debating what to do very well, for long. Yeah. Yeah and clear, like, like,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### had some

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### knowledge of how to use a cup of sight. I felt like we were arguing a lot about, about how to use a compass or what to do with it in certain situations. And so it secretes.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Do you think you know now? What was wrong with her position or whether her position had any value? Yeah, I've

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### been actually puzzling about that all week. And

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I, I think we

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### should offer I think, because it was like cold it was. I don't know, I maybe I could have handled that better, I

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### think I'd like to ask her.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I think the main thing we kept arguing about like, is, was things I think is, um, I don't know, maybe it's just the way she did it. But, like, at one control point, there's another person happening here.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### And she started giving some advice to

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Karen was a total beginner. And Claire had some knowledge, but not a lot of experience, applying it. And I had, you know, more experience and more application experience. So, um, but so I was, like, clear, and I'm like telling Karen different things. And then this other person who just happened to be there as the control point started giving Karen advice that was like, Oh, wait. So I felt kind of bad for Karen getting everybody. Oh, I think everybody familiar with my surprise. So at the end, she, like didn't wants to do it again. And so she's like, Come again. At Mount Tom's there's gonna be one at Mount Tom, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and she might come out to that. And Ruby. So actually, I told Jake, Jackie and Ruby, I kind of have a plan to do a little orienteering lesson with each of them separately, before we go. So that like, while you're indoors or not. So we can, like have a little baseline before we get out there.

#### Yeah, I was clear, it was like so. So like, I think, like, kind of like the first thing you need to learn and and what you would learn what would be really all you'd need to do if you actually started on this course, which is probably technically the best way to do it is like how to orient your map. So you, like have your map actually. So that north on the map is facing is pointing north. orienting your map. And Karen the whole time like she actually never understood that. Like she she kept saying, I don't understand the point of this. What is the point?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### What? Oh, hmm. So even the end never understood it? No, she never did. Oh,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### well, that's one thing. So I mean, I think and then I reread some of the books that I had learned from some of the summit. And I mean, I don't know if maybe she felt like Well, what's the point in your conference when you ought to be able to orient it by the world? Just by looking around because the book was kinda like well, it's actually it's actually good to to orient your map based on looking around and then you could like confirm with your compass that you've done it right. But no, she didn't seem to get it which I think either means that she is very spatially aware and like doesn't need to have the map properly the map oriented in order to use it or, or she just doesn't really get it. I'm kind of thinking is the second one, but she wants to do it more and see let's not let's go here's the thing are arguing with Claire about so. So we're orienting up every time like I'm sort of a lot of times saying or getting mad every time we you know, you're sort of stopped or a map. And Claire said okay, here's a map to put you know that you have like the dial. She's she had this stuff with the dial. So you turn the dial. Like I never really understood take like you don't need to turn the dial like or anything when you just look at the needle, you don't do anything with the dial. But she was doing something with a dial and I don't know what I still don't know I've been kind of struggling over that. Whether it's just like sort of a weakness thing. Like you want to have your dials pointing towards north. You want to line up north with the arrow and they sweat baseplate just so it's sort of Meteor that way or like a way of kind of just having it be random. That's I think that would be the most reasonable in the last couple of days. You have this, I think that would be the most reasonable thing. explanation that maybe just this always orient, orienting the dial. So that north winds up it just makes it. It's just like a way of meeting things up or something. Huh,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### yeah. So.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Okay, so you and I,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### um, yeah, I guess that her belief does sound like it has low utility.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### You know, yeah, maybe next time I ask asked me about what you do, like, I didn't really do that. I just was like,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### yeah. Anyway, I wish I had a mailing list. Where I didn't know all the people that I would I would just trust that. I would like whoever happened to be on it.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, that is kind of a situation that was

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I'm waiting for that. Or I mean, I

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### guess, I mean, I wasn't guaranteed to like, but I guess I had

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### you. You like far more people than I like?

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yes, that is true. That probably is true.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, as far as I can tell. I like perhaps. I think it's on the order of 1% of people.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Hmm. So like, like, how do you define like, like, is like, entail?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Like, okay, so, I guess I would rephrase that, um, I only would really value long term notice. Like, there's only 1% of people for whom I would put in effort to to develop a long term relationship of some time.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I mean, I guess, you know, I,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I, well, I'm

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### kind of shifting now. Like, I'd like to put more effort into maintaining your long term relationship. I mean, if you think about the people that I know, I mean, I actually do put effort into maintaining a relationship with probably less than 1% of people. That I know, you know what I mean, and it's like, but I happen to have this like moms group that kind of, you know, it provides, like, I don't control who goes when they have a thing, but I just go and I enjoyed hanging out with whoever I'm hanging out with, but I don't really, you don't I mean, that sort of different than putting effort.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Okay. So for me, the people outside of that 1% are people for whom I would have who, but basically people outside of that 1% can only provide me with a limited amount of value in their entire life, I think. So, for those people I might talk to them for I might spend, okay, it's not that short, but like, once I've spent perhaps, like 10 hours with them, I wouldn't see any more value I could get out of them. And that that's sort of different between me and you like you can you enjoy hanging out with people, even if they're like, nothing, there's nothing special about them. Well, I don't really true.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### That's true. I mean, I started a conversation with the person in front of me in line at the farmers market about the recipe she was planning to make with the spinach that she was holding, and I enjoyed that.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, like I would not enjoy that. I'd be like spinach. Who cares? I'd be like, why are you wasting your time thinking about spins that off? The better thing to do is do I like spinach is good, but you don't actually get more value out of spinach by thinking about spinach than by dislike these spinach and not thinking about it.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Haven't had to prepare your own meals. Much

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I have had to do.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Well, you have had to, yeah,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I I do it when I have to. I use like the path of least resistance to create meals, which do not involve talking about meals.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Unlike some people, you know, we talked about the meal before the meal during

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### and after the meal. Yeah. Toxic thinking about it. That's probably, it's probably not true that, that a lot of people have a limit on to total value. But I think a lot of I think there are a lot of classes of people for whom I would rather get scientific data, then meet them in person. That's what I would say. So if you're normal, if you're normal enough, I would just rather read some papers about some studies that they did on normal people then meet you.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Finish this meantime.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, that's more valuable to me, than someone talking about their spirit.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### mean, I guess I found Well, I guess I'm gonna make a comment about spinach. But this isn't really about. It's

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### about people.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I mean, but like, when you say value, I mean, you feel like every person has value.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Okay. So there's a there's a difference. So everybody has intrinsic value. Everybody has intrinsic value. But interactions have extrinsic value, like I value the interaction, for the results of that interaction. And really, it's not

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### like we're just complaining that dad was like, and you're not like

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### that yet? No. Well, he is not, he doesn't think long term very much. So if you think that each interaction will give you value, that, and there's like a fallacy where you can say, Oh, this won't give me value in the short run. So I won't do it. But, you know, a lot of times, you need to have many interactions to get the long run value. You know, like, I didn't go on a date, because I thought that, like, each date is immediate value that is only good for that one thing. It's like, it's about a relationship, which takes a long time to produce value, but it's still about the value in the end, not about, you know, liking to it's more about the long term value than is about wanting to get something in a short run. So they Yeah, thinking about the consequences. And total value. Is, is very good when you think long term.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I guess. Yeah, I mean, I guess for me, I, I would just be kind of lonely. Like I like talking to people.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, so we just had different thresholds. Like, I can talk to people, I think, my thresholds been going up. But no, if I talk to people for like, two hours a day, I really don't need any more. talking to people, you know, I won't feel happier for talking to people for four hours and talking to people for two hours. So yeah, actually,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### pretty good. Yeah. Yeah,

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### it's probably but but I think what I get out of talking to people is different, though, than what you get out of it. Like what? Well, I also, um, get like, I guess built in social built in socialization benefits, like, your brain needs. social interaction. So yeah, I also have that, but for me, it's also like intellectual stimulation that's very important. And having a conversation that I don't find interesting. doesn't really feel like It's, it's, I'm in a weird situation because I do need to talk to people from spurn psychology. But I also need to do it for intellectual reasons, I guess. And I find it difficult to get one without the other. Like, yeah, I don't really like I feel like I might actually benefit from if I could arm, like, get alleviate loneliness by talking to anyone. But I find that I can't do that.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### So you mean like if you if you did, you'd be just kind of bored and annoyed?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### So I think not not as annoyed anymore. I think I've gotten better about that. But yeah, bored. I would like fall asleep or something. Yeah, yeah, I

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### wouldn't hold your interest.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Oh, I should, I should try it more, I think. I haven't been trying it quite enough. But like, there's some interactions that definitely not good. Like, there is this group that I sit with physics. And in this group, they like this one guy. And I sit next to this guy. And the first thing he said was, oh, here are the answers to the questions that we have to be solving. And like, I could, you could just tell that he thought that was the only thing that was important. And like, from that moment, you know, the amount of value that I can. So yeah, it's not that he doesn't have value, it's that I can't extract any value out of him. And I don't see an easy way for me to add value to him, either. So if either I see how they can give me value, or I see an easy way for me to give them value, and then I'll try to interact with him. You know, he just has this very interest, this very stable, long term mindset of just, you know, doing what you're told, and like, that knowledge isn't important, and that sort of stuff. And because I'm very interested in, you know, finding the truth, someone with that mindset can't prove provide me very much value. And because it's so entrenched in him, I don't see how I can provide him much value. And like, he already has the answers to this problem that you have to solve. So he doesn't see, like, from his perspective, he doesn't really have any much any more value to gain out of class, right? He already is gonna get a good grade, he's not going to be looking for extra value. I don't really know how to give him any extra value. So and it was this was that was a sad like a physic also like, at once. No, no, no, that lecture. Yeah. But so at that class, we had to like work in groups to do this thing. Okay. It had he solved the problem. No, no, he just was looking at like a piece of paper that had the solutions to the problem, and just copying.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Oh, yeah, that does indicate, suggest an attitude about what you're at school to do. Yeah. What's the point of colleges? or something along those lines?

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### Yeah, so that's a case where I just don't see where the value can be gained from an interaction. I think, I think over the long term, like people like that are very influenced by like, social status, and they want to, they want to imitate people who they admire. So one thing that I could do is if I persistently get better grades than him and have the attitude that I have that might team that might affect him, right? If after a term He's like, Oh, Tao, how do you get such good grades? I'm like, because I really care about learning quantum mechanics, then he'll be like, Hmm, maybe I should really care about like quantum mechanics. But again, studying quantum again. Yeah. Yeah. So that sort of thing. would have value to him. But like, I only sat next to him once it's, I can't exactly do that. Right. So yeah,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I mean, I, there's a certain Well, for me, I guess I have a certain level of just curiosity, like so it's not really so much like whether somebody is going to provide me value in terms of like something I need. But

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### you know, I guess, yeah, well, there are a lot of people for whom I have curiosity. But the problem is that, I think that I have a very, I've somewhat good knowledge of what beliefs and worldviews and practices are normal. And if I, if I know that someone really cares about fitting in, and really cares about meeting expectations, to a really high degree, then I pretty much already know all their positions and worldviews and stuff. I don't really need to ask them about them. Um, well,

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### I mean, you're taking psychology now. Right? Like, I mean, I mean, I think you can only go to a deeper level if, or

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### in theory, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So that is true. Like, every case studies is everybody like everybody has some sort of something to add to a psychological case study. But he also, I'm, I'm not exactly the best at getting down. That getting down into what's important about a person quickly. I, I generally find that I don't know how to get them to say what they really think or get them to talk about something that makes them different. Right. And, yeah, so I think if I if I was able to do that better than I might get more value out of these sorts of things.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah. I was just ever watched Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.

### [[Tao Lin]]
#### I've heard of it. No, I haven't watched it. I can. No, I watched like, 10 minutes of it on YouTube once. What did you think about it? Um, it didn't seem any worse than like, other random, like, kids, so? I don't know. Yeah.

### [[Ellie Lin]]
#### Yeah, maybe this will be last night cuz you haven't, don't really have the experience of it. But um, I was just listening to radio this morning. And the so I guess Tom Hanks plays Mr. Rogers in a movie that's coming out now and Cisco's interviewing Tom Hanks about it. And sort of at the end of the interview, the interviewer said, so I have a friend Rogers story. So tell Mr. Rogers is like, he talks about feelings a lot. And, you know, he was an ordained minister actually found out on this thing. And so he kind of started this show in sort of the, the mission of helping kids learn about sort of emotional IQ and pre printed animals like you and kind of feel feel valued and good. That is good. And so this, so this interviewer, he was, he was at this party opening reception for something for public radio station or something. And Fred Rogers was there, and he was there. And he said, he had recently written an essay about the death of his cat. And published somewhere. And so Fred Rogers, like, you know, he met Fred Rogers at this party. And, and Fred said, so he had a hard time lately, and he said, Oh, yeah, you know, long flight here. He said, No, I mean, your chat and they like, started this conversation about his cat and like, How sad he was, or how sad it is when your cat dies. I guess it's why am I bringing this up? That maybe it's an example of like, when you're at a party doing small talk, you don't expect to be talking about your cat dying. But But, but then this person just that's kind of his, his mo is he's like, very, kind of in the nitty gritty of emotions and that sort of how he interacts with People? Yeah,
