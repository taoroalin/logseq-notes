## Finally debugged in Unity! it's f11

## Unity freezes on play when headset not plugged in?

## Computer speed: restart 40s, chrome reopen 70s, unity and VS open 190s (could probably have been faster, like 160s)

## [[Unity]] stock: bought at 158. Now that I've used it more, less optimistic about it. this is "private information", in that update time was specific to me.
