## [[consent]] I like not having to talk sometimes.

## Fucking C!!! "At the start 50% of your problems will be about the compiler not doing what you expect, this is normal" this is so true!!!!!

## I need to keep track of my [[C Q]]uestions

## [[C Q]] Are things automatically initialized in C++?

## Challenge for myself: solve the following problems in C in leetcode today (day by sleep cycle)
### implement linked list
#### whoa what the fuck I can dealloc the thing as I go. work out in the void of disconnected memory.

#### is that faster?

#### asm for function?

#### ASM for loop?
##### ```javascript
```

### implement doubly linked list

### implement hash table

### Maybe not today, but I want to create the preorder stored tree [[Casey Muratori]] was takling about

## Wow in casey muratori's mock interview they talked about loading the exact memory for a game from disk and just loading file+setting up pointers at startup instead of initializing everything. There should be a library for this!!!

### Q&A: isn't a lot of learning just drugework?
#### A: PUBG is also drudgework, but people still want to do it.
