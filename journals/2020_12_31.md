## Has general curve of risk / reward changed a lot since [[Ancestral Environment]]?
### Yes. In ancestral environment, lots of things could have serious downside, like death. Now that level of downside is almost gone, while upsides have gone up.

## Is the answer to bad software "tighter stacks" (like [[JAI]]) or better frameworks, like [[DOTS]]

## [[Quest]] Controller model in game should NEVER contain tracking ring! it just gets in the way, no one needs to see it!

### awesome!

### We both thought of transitive enforced purity! he has a more gradual version, where you can capture outer state whenever you want and compile check that you don't use any other outer state.

### "average piracy rate for PC games is 85% of total users" WTF I thought it would be so much lower!!!

## Is it possible to build an (almost) [[Zero Overhead Web Framework/Method]]? 
### What needs to happen?
#### Initial load **must be html/css**. 100% initial screen must render without any JS.

#### One input, one server request. That means initial load is 1 file, when user presses button it loads 1 file, ect.

#### Practices for html/css must be minimal. Use as many CSS defaults as you can, including accessibility. 
##### Only use css that behaves the same across browsers
###### [[Formally define subset of CSS that somewhat makes sense, renders identically on browsers, runs fast]]

##### [[Remember people's browsers and only send them css for that browser]] this would have to be seperate request, not great

#### Always send web request immediately on input

### Ideas
#### Queue button presses while JS is loading

#### Is there a way to reduce cache misses in JS? [[AQ]]
