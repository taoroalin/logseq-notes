## [[Roam]][[Improvements]]autofocus top block on daily notes, maybe always

## I have repeatedly liked and unliked "Who do you love" by the chainsmokers.

## in my dream i did lots of stuff!
### got capured in waritme setting inside this house. I was captive at top of stairs by tribe painted guy who looked kinda like me. I poked him in eye with fork covered in nanobots, then had those bots block his vains. He put his genes in my gametes? before that I was a crocadile like thing with fire powers. fought bigger crocodile who seemed invincible and huge and unfair. he ropped my left arm off. I feel like that happens a lot to crocodiles.

### earlier I complained I wake up in night. girl said what wakes you up, is it orgasm.(this was her pickup line) was gonna have se, I was gonna do it and then woke myself up. 

### remember earlier dream I'm at cafeteria with Bev, looks different, two tiers of three tiered space were dining, top tier was serving, these are floors that look out into a common space with lots of windows, are stepped. 

## [[OpenGL]]
### Vertex Array Objects (VAO) contain multiple Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO) which are actual arrays of vertices!!!

### Geometry Shaders create additional vertices

## I think that undoubtedly VR causes eye strain and wear, but i'm sure it's on the same order as desktop eye strain.

## What would graphics API be like?
### how are all the things for one object, vertices, textures, ect linked?

### OMG I thought I was halucinating when music was off tone on Quest!!!

## An extreme way to reduce motion sickness in VR is to fill inner ears with ferrofluid and move it around with magnets in the headset

## [[VR visualization]] embedding yourself in visualization
### Embedding yourself in multiple visualizations. Don't think seperating them spacially would be good, more seperating by color / constantly there at low opacity / fade between.
