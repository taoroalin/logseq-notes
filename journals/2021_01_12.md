## THE THING THAT MAKES BAD DSL (DOMAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGES) S BAD IS QUOTING. THEY ALWAYS START WITH LITERAL TEXT IN SOME PLACES, AND THEN THEY ADD VARIABLES, WHICH NEED SOME SORT OF QUOTING, AND THEN FUNCTIONS THAT TAKE QUOTED STUFF, AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA WHEN YOU'RE IN QUOTE MODE. ONLY LISP/CLOJURE DSLS AVOID THIS PROBLEM, THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM GREAT. PARSE TREE AMBIGUITY IS THE BANE OF DSL S. (THIS IS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE I FUCKED UP MY AUTOHOTKEY SCRIPT BECAUSE OF FUCKING QUOTE AMBIGUITIES)

### What is the point of it all? What does it all mean?

In this talk I explain how we can meaningfully address these questions with the frame of "consciousness vs. pure replicators". This framework allows us to re-interpret and unify all previous "scales of moral/conceptual development". In turn, it makes solving disagreements in a principled way possible. 

"Consciousness vs. Pure Replicators" is what I call "the universal plot of reality"; it is the highest level of narrative that determines what is "relevant to the plot" at any given point in time.

Whether consciousness succeeds at gaining control of its destiny and embarks on a collective journey of self-authorship, or whether we all end up being subservient cogs to a self-replicating mega-system whose one and only utility function is to self-perpetuate, is truly up in the air right now. So what can we do to support the interests of consciousness, then?

To aid consciousness we need more than good intentions (though those are still a key ingredient): I discuss how game theoretical considerations entail that in order for consciousness to succeed we will need to judiciously ally with specific replicator strategies. Being a "cooperatebot" towards anyone who claims to care about consciousness makes you liable to being resource-pumped. You need to verify that something makes sense also from the point of view of game theory; without a way to verify the ultimate values of others, coordinating with them at this level becomes extremely challenging. I suggest that a mature technology of intelligent bliss with objectively verifiable effects would be a game-changer. Once you've seen "it" (i.e. optimized bliss consciousness) you join everyone else in self-organizing around it.

If the world is to be taken over by something that cares about the wellbeing of consciousness, how this taking over process looks like may blindside us all. The power of "universal love" conquering all obstacles and creating a paradise for all may not be a New Age fantasy after all. Given the appropriate technology, it may turn out to be a live option...
