######## [[Coinbase]] [[Values]]
######### Play as a Championship Team
########## **Be company first: **We act as #OneCoinbase, putting the company’s goals ahead of any particular team or individual goals.

########## **Act in service of the greater mission: **We have united as a team to try and accomplish something that none of us could have done on our own.

########## **Default to trust: **We assume positive intent amongst our teammates, and assume ignorance over malice. We have each other’s backs.

########## **Focus on what unites us, not what divides us: **We help create a sense of cohesion and unity, by focusing on what we have in common, not where we disagree, especially when it’s unrelated to our work.

########## **Sustained high performance: **As compared to a family, where everyone is included regardless of performance, a championship team makes a concerted effort to raise the bar on talent, including changing out team members when needed.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:8e34e0fe-c5fe-4805-bbb9-e9b211950f34
:END:

######### Focus on building
########## We focus on things that help us achieve our mission
########### **Build great products:** The vast majority of the impact we have will be from the products we create, which are used by millions of people.

########### **Source amazing talent: **We create job opportunities for top people, including those from underrepresented backgrounds who don’t have equal access to opportunities, with things like diverse slates (Rooney rule) on senior hires, and casting a wide net to find top talent.

########### **Fair talent practices: **We work to reduce unconscious bias in interviews, using things like structured interviews, and ensure fair practices in how we pay and promote. We have a pay for performance culture, which means that your rewards and promotions are linked to your overall contribution to the mission and company goals.

########### **Enable belonging for everyone: **We work to create an environment where everyone is welcome and can do their best work, regardless of background, sexual orientation, race, gender, age, etc.

########## We focus minimally on causes not directly related to the mission:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:58dd6d27-5879-4ade-b5f1-b73ff56bd1c2
:END:
########### **Policy decisions**: If there is a bill introduced around crypto, we may engage here, but we normally wouldn’t engage in policy decisions around healthcare or education for example.

########### **Non-profit work: **We will do some work here with our Pledge 1% program and GiveCrypto.org, but this is about 1% of our efforts. We are a for-profit business. When we make profit, we can use that to hire more great people, and build even more. We shouldn’t ever shy away from making profit, because with more resources we can have a greater impact on the world.

########### **Broader societal issues: **We don’t engage here when issues are unrelated to our core mission, because we believe impact only comes with focus.

########### **Political causes: **We don’t advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission. Even if we all agree something is a problem, we may not all agree on the solution.

######### [[Agreements]]
########## We won’t:
########### Debate causes or political candidates internally that are unrelated to work

########### Expect the company to represent our personal beliefs externally

########### Assume negative intent, or not have each others back

########### Take on activism outside of our core mission at work

########## We will:
########### Fight to get on the same page when we have differences

########### Support each other, and create team cohesion

########### Assume positive intent

##### One thing that helps me be productive is just being around inspiring people, which is a big part of ((b6f43d2c-fcff-48df-bab4-b39fb8df107f)). I also need access to the code, an efficient code deployment / code review system. I work a bit better when I'm delivering something to my manager on the order of twice / three times a week, and I don't do as well when I have to self-organize much longer projects.

##### I felt like I was crushing it (compared to normal) on my Roam application process, actually. It helped that I respect [[Conaw]], and felt like he would honestly tell me when I fucked up.  I was also very productive in my robotics team at [[WPI]], where I also respected my boss. Back then I didn't understand as much of the world, and that actually helped me be more productive in the moment. Now I feel so many more forces pulling on me, it can be distracting.

#### ((0f633cef-c371-4539-ab06-ff6fd1c089d8))
##### I'm guilty of half-assing it when my boss doesn't criticize me for my mistakes. In my current internship, my boss is extremely "nice", in that he never pushes me, and I end up working very few hours.

###### If you are already rewriting queries, then this might not be the best project for me to have an impact immediately.

###### ((1742bf56-dae2-496d-9cff-b68e29db6b7e))
####### If queries can impact queries, and queries impact notifications, that means you might have to execute every query even if none are shown on screen. Ones that don't impact what's shown on screen right now, only notifications, can be done async and slower.

####### There are optimizations that reduce how many queries you need to run. First, if there's no overlap between tags in changed blocks and in query, query doesn't need to be run. Only the queries that include pages in changed blocks  need to be run, then if those queries change, queries that reference them need to be run, until they settle. 

###### ((d5a8ae79-f316-4b35-b683-db8e83269a4d))
####### The obvious thing to do is to partially rerun queries. That means start with the old query result and add/delete thiings that were changed from each query

####### A first attempt might be to run every changed block through each query, and then run each of those queries that's actually changed through each query, over and over until they settle or too much time passes. Only trigger notifications at the end.

###### ((9106b077-09f3-475b-be43-4442868b0435))
####### if a query has notifications, then it has to be rerun every time, unfortunately. Otherwise every query should only be run when either

####### Ideally, the computer only does as much work as the difference between the pixels shown before, and the pixels shown after. Think about what information absolutely must be known in order for the answer to remain the same, and don't store / compute anything else.

###### I don't really understand this principle, but I definitely see things that match up with it. The idea that just hierarchical organization (workflowy) plus graph based, organic organization, can store practically all the complexity of information, is profound.

## The world desperately needs a high performance virtual world. Oculus could come out with one, but that would have downsides. (rn the problem is more client side. this is more a game engine problem than a server problem)

## [[Example Roam Page]]

## [[Roam]][[Performance]]
### very small roam page has 26kb html body. takes 500ms to render.

### js takes 2s to compile. that's just too much time.

## [[Qualia I've Experienced]]
### Astral projection. sadly I

### This is great! once again, people knew about the stuff I'm finding out about now like 6 years ago!

### Heritability of one’s attitudes toward gay rights range from 0.3 to 0.5, which hilariously is a little more heritable than homosexuality itself
#### ah, if only homosexuality was far more heritable than anti-homosexuality, no one would have issues with coming out to their parents!
##### actually no cause gay people don't have enough kids

## webpack allows dynamic import in browser with template strings by sending every file that could be imported from that template. this is absolute super-saiyan level idiocy. no one has ever actually wanted to send that much unused code!!!

## Me, about my cat: "she's nonverbal" [[Tao Quotes]]

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] page titles should be case insensitive! when we change, we can give warning first. Also, we can just merge pages with same name, vast majority want this anyway

## TODO #DigiKey 
### get rid of normal md docs

### get import working

### make optional show code in stories

## One of the most important things Roam needs to work on is reducing fragmentation into multiple graphs, likely using more customizable sharing/security. Splitting stuff up between multiple graphs feels awful, needs to stop. we need to somehow feel safe keeping our stuff in as few graphs as possible.

## Need to relay information immediately when I get it.
