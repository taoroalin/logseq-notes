## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] Add a [[[[roam/css]] raw mode]]. **This removes all native roam css, allowing roam/css create more different and more reliable customizations**

## [[Roam]] [[Eliana]]
### Templates great

### Open pages that reference each other beside each other
#### Is this Ctrl+Shift+O. This doesn't work for Ellie, it opens bookmarks instead

#### Also she says

### TABLES!!!
#### intersection tables
##### `{{:cross-reference {{[[LO]][[KH]] null}} {{[[ComplexSystems]][[Analysis]] null}} }}`

##### names for this feature: `:cross-reference :intersection-table :intersect

##### What to do

#### Just editable tables. Input in each table, enter creates new row, tab across, ect.

#### {{[[table]] null}}
##### hello
###### and hello

### Diagrams
#### {{[[diagram]] null}}
##### hello?
###### inside hello

##### and other

#### Allow for nesting inside diagrams. nested blocks inside diagrams are little nodes that are automatically connected to parents in diagram.[[Roam]][[Improvements]]

### ranking system for block reference autocomplete. What to use??

### block reference conversations

## The Problem:: [[Roam Parser]] copied from https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/NYgRwJaQM
### [[Take Home Project]]  [[Backend Role]] [[parser]]
#### Context::
##### https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1333174002550927360?s=20

#### Folks have asked us for a backend problem - comparable to the screen we put up for [[UI Engineer]]
##### We don't have a first filter problem - so we'll just give you one that is useful for us - and since it is useful - if you meet all these requirements all the way -- we'll give you an immediate bounty of $5,000 - and you'll immediately have passed to the final round of interviews where you meet the whole team.

#### This is not `strictly` backend - it's data transformation - but our team is still mostly front-end engineers, so it's a bit tougher for us to come up with a proper backend problem.

#### Related - if you give us a better problem that we go with instead - and that problem is answered within 1 month -- we'll give you $10,000 -- that's ongoing, for all our roles.

#### description::
##### We try to keep some plaintext representation of all the data folks store in Roam - so that folks can own their data in an actionable real way - take it with them if they leave - or (less risk now that we're profitable and funded) have security if Roam ever disappears.

##### There are some bugs in our parser - it doesn't handle certain kinds of nesting - and it is a bit of a pain to extend -- also - it is painful whenever we want to make up more specific syntax - like for queries.

##### We've been meaning to re-write it.  

##### If you show you can do a better job that we would - we want to talk to you.

#### Scope::
##### 5 - 20 hrs

#### Criteria::

#### TODO The parser can parse all of Roam's major syntax at least `[[link]]` `((ref))``{{roam-render null}}` `$$latex$$` `[alias](target)` `^^highlight^^` `**bold**` `__italic__`
##### TODO The parser is recursive - it can handle [[Nested [[Links]]]] and ^^**bold highlights^^** and `[html roam]([[Aliases]])`all the ones we haven't done yet as well

##### Specifically ```javascript

Aliases inside aliases
>   
  [![img](image-as-alias.com)](www.roamreasearch.com)

{{{{curlybraces null}} in{{side null}} of {{curlybraces null}}}}


```

##### TODO Return a Tree - with the result of the parse.

##### TODO Provide an abstraction for Replacing each item in the tree with something else (like an html component, or a new string value)
###### One aspect of a winning solution might be the equivalent of update-in for a parsed section of the string.
####### Similar to how we might update in a map with swap!

####### aka - you give us the parsed value in an atom - if we reset that atom, it should change the string at the location of the parse.

##### TODO Your solution is fast for most cases - it can parse - and replace a string with a hiccup component in - for example 1000strings in under 500ms
###### More points for faster
####### As long as you make it through 95% of them in under 500ms, and push the others off to finish in under 1s

##### TODO Other ones to thing about
###### ```javascript
a very winning solution could parse arbitrary code - with an easy abstraction for extending it.
example - using insect.js in calculations - and replacing variables with their definitions.

or taking something like

user wants to find the time between to pieces of text

you write a parser that looks for a pattern like this - and can then replace it.

<%%:%% - %%:%%>
13:41 - 14:03  and then replace the whole thing with tthe result of adding them together - or add the string (time % hours) after


{:inc 1} {:do-something This | That} 
{âˆ†: {:style :snooze, :delay 1day, :every 2hours, :rule (if (= 2 2) (inc :delay) (dec :delay))} }```

## [[CLJS]] [[Performance]]
### Why does this take so long? 
#### ```javascript
// Compiled by ClojureScript 1.10.773 {}
goog.provide('seven_guis.scratch');
goog.require('cljs.core');
seven_guis.scratch.stime = performance.now();
cljs.core.print.call(null,(function (){var text = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ";
var range = (new cljs.core.List(null,cljs.core.range.call(null,(10000)),null,(1),null));
return cljs.core.reduce.call(null,(function (x1,x2){
return (x1 + (function (){var i = (0);
while(true){
if((((i >= x2)) || ((i >= ((text).length))) || (cljs.core.not_EQ_.call(null,cljs.core.nth.call(null,text,i),"a")))){
return i;
} else {
var G__57551 = (i + (1));
i = G__57551;
continue;
}
break;
}
})());
}),(0),range);
})());
console.log((performance.now() - seven_guis.scratch.stime));
seven_guis.scratch.parse_lisp = (function seven_guis$scratch$parse_lisp(text){
var word_regex = /^ ?[^\(\) ] ?/;
var text_left = text;
var tree = cljs.core.PersistentVector.EMPTY;
var idx_stack = cljs.core.PersistentVector.EMPTY;
while(true){
var match = cljs.core.re_matches.call(null,word_regex,text);
return null;
break;
}
});
```

#### ```javascript
(let [text "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa "
                      range (list (range 10000))]
                  (reduce (fn [x1 x2]
                            (+ x1 (loop [i 0]
                                    (if (or (>= i x2) (>= i (count text)) (not= (nth text i) "a")) i (recur (inc i)))))) 0.0 range))```

### I think it's because it's creating the full recursion stack at some level.

### When I call `(.log js/console)` it actually calls cljs print. That calls like 10 wrapper functions! It looks like that takes significant time! How can I just call fucking console.log?!?!?! If I wanted cljs print, I would have said `(print)`!!!!

### 

## [[JS]] would it be reasonable to add a last() method to the base Array? it's so ugly using [array.length-1] everywhere. I think the answer is probably no :(

## [[JS]][[Performance]]
### People like [[D3JS]] and [[WebGL]] examples use their own pseudorandom number generators instead of ```javascript
Math.random()```

### ```javascript
var g_randSeed = 0;
var g_randRange = Math.pow(2, 32);
function pseudoRandom() {
    return (g_randSeed = (134775813 * g_randSeed + 1) % g_randRange) /
            g_randRange;
}```

## [[[[Roam Parser]] [[JS]]]]
### Should the parser support partially overlapping emphasis? For example ^^highlight **highlight and bold^^ just bold **? low priority, but an option

### [[Bracket Priority Algorithm]]
#### The Problem:: in roam if you have the beginning of a bold ** and then a [[Page Ref with **]] then the page ref is real, and the bold is not. Also, when you have multiple sets of starting brackets like [[preamble [[Page Ref]], then only the closest pair is real. This means you need a way to create parts of a parse tree, and then destroy them (turn them into plain text nodes) if they get overridden.
##### hello!::

##### currently in roam parser highlights go over page refs, but bold doesn't. [[Ask [[Conaw]]]] why this is.

#### The Algorithm::
##### [[Options]]
###### **Maybe the stack isn't actually a stack**

###### One of the core insights of fancy parser algorithms is to use a tree shaped stack

###### Hacky:: whenever you see a beginning bracket with higher priority than current bracket, use regex to see which closing comes first. 

###### Whenever you see a closing bracket from a lower priority down in the stack, record that. Then at

##### At the end of the string, if there's anything still on the stack, splice its stuff back out / re-parse it.

### they used mesh spheres in 3d. why oh why...
