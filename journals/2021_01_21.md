## [[Idea for a front-end framework]]
### What would the ideal front end framework be? I think it would be based around something like Datascript. **The core feature is that updates are made through the dependency graph in the datascript, not the graph of the DOM**. Meaning, there's a datascript datom `[datom-id :showing dom-node]` for each dom attribute /// inner text / whatver that is computed from that datom, and whenever a datom gets updated all its :showing functions get recomputed. There are seperate datoms for UI state, and when one of them changes large parts of the dom get swapped out.
#### This has issues with multiple things being changed at once

## [[Oxford EA fellowship]]

#### Attempt to copy this from [[Notion to Roam]]
##### [ ]  Check out the published curriculum for the Fellowship [here](https://www.notion.so/In-Depth-Fellowship-Curriculum-8d3e887d4b4d41c8bc3138a9006bac9e)

##### The Fellowship will involve 8 weeks of reading and discussion (in groups of 4 or 5 with a moderator in each discussion). We'll also hold extra socials and Q&As on top of discussions, as well as hosting a Slack workspace where we can all discuss resources, collaborate on projects and arrange discussions. You'll be assigned reading and/or an exercise each week so make sure to leave time to look at those before the session!
###### [ ]  **Makes sure to check out the short exercise for the first week!**

##### [ ]  Join the In-Depth Fellowship Slack using [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/indepthfellowship/shared_invite/zt-kz0qr2ra-w7g~xmVjYUCwOX1PNZ64Qw)

##### The Slack is where we will post announcements, share resources, chat about EA, and chat about basically anything else. I strongly encourage reaching out to other Fellows on the Slack and reaching out to me (Will Payne) or your groups moderator if you have any issues.

##### [ ]  Find out which group you are a part of using [this link](https://airtable.com/shrHIykXeJrAGS5PK)

##### You will discuss the content of the Fellowship with the same group each week. **The first discussion call will be held next week (starting Monday 25th).** You can find the time your group will meet, name of the other Fellows in your group, and name of your moderator in the linked list.

##### You will also be sent a google calendar invite to that groups first session tomorrow, the Zoom link for the session will be contained in the google calendar event.

##### [ ]  Reach out to your group moderator on Slack (they'll be able to add you to a private chat for your group)

##### You can use that chat to discuss what you want to talk about in the session, follow up with discussions after, and rearrange sessions if needed.

##### [ ]  Have a look at [this collection](https://airtable.com/shrSEdE75XrtjMbJg) of short bios for Fellows

##### [ ]  Check out [this FAQ](https://www.notion.so/In-Depth-Fellowship-FAQs-3e5516a6b5f14c789c1e5f140cc972d2) for the Fellowship and message me (Will Payne) on Slack if you have any more questions

##### **If someone raises a question or concern that I haven't addressed here (or in the FAQ) I will add it below so check back on this page if something seems missing**ðŸ™‚

## [[Graph Layout]][[Performance]][[HTML5 Canvas]]
### Drawing circles takes far more time than drawing text or rectangles. It looks like 3x the time to draw a circle vs short text

### Fuck me! It runs 4 times slower on Firefox than on Chrome! Should have tested other browsers sooner!

## [[Roam Parser]]
### [[Options]]
#### multipass (lex -> parse page refs / aliases -> parse styling)
##### Lexer
###### Right now [[CLJS]] version takes 150ms, [[JS]] version takes 15ms. Same big O(n), but one has more bloat.

            (recur (:end match) (subs text (- (:end match) (:start match))) (conj tokens match)))))))```

####### ```javascript
        const tokenTypes = [
            { re: /^https?:\/\/([a-zA-Z]+\.)?[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]+(\/[a-zA-Z]*)*(\?([a-zA-Z]+=[a-zA-Z]+))*/, tag: "url" },

            return tokens;
        }```

####### note: this lexer has bug with text followed by url

#### branching/backtracking parser

#### multipass [[Instaparse]]

### [[[[CLJS]] [[JS]] differences]]
#### ```javascript
(re-matches #"\[\[" "[[") doesn't work, but
"[[".match(/\[\[/) works```
##### IDK why

#### Difference in speed betwen js and cljs arrays for lots of appends is something like 10%. 

## [[Frank Lantz]] recommends [[Michael Brough]] http://www.smestorp.com/

## [[High Performance JS Book]] seems outdated. For example, they recommend innerHTML over dom nodes, even though chrome just made dom faster as they were writing book. Lots of the internal stuff in browsers and JS engines has changed.
### yeah this seems like "here's a bug in browsers (IE, old firefox, whatever), that makes X slow. Do y instead". This knowledge is inherently short term.

## development speed working on performance in [[JS]] vs [[CLJS]]:
### [[JS]]
#### Code evaluates on save in <100ms.

#### performance is as transparent as possible in browser

### [[CLJS]]
#### Only know how fast your code is after minutes-long compiler optimizations

#### performance is unpredictable
