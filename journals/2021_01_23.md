## [[Graph Layout]][[Performance]][[HTML5 Canvas]]
### The chrome profiler says that chrome batches up beginPath and moveTo. this is surprising, I would expect it to start a path and then finish it, not start lots??? it makes sense for cache locality though.
#### [[January 24th, 2021]] this seems to be the profiler taking a shortcut more than the behavior actually being weird

### You need to finish your [[requestAnimationFrame]] very early in order to hit the next frame. For example, there are 16 miliseconds between every frame of a 60 hertz monitor, but you need to finish your work in 13 ms in order for the browser to schedule you on the very next frame.

## [[Graph Layout]][[Cross Browser]]

## [[Graph Layout]]
### I can sort the nodes by their connection count in order to render bigger ones / smaller ones on top of I want.

### [[UI]]
#### TODO make render work on firefox

#### TODO make sensical way to customize text size

#### TODO make zoom-to-mouse work

#### TODO Fit graph to canvas on start 

#### DONE precompute text width

#### TODO detect click on node
##### because node list is rendered beginning to end, iterate backwards through node list to get node drawn on top first

#### DONE Match label background to title size

#### DONE Switch quadtree to use center-width instead of start-end

## [[Graph Layout]]
### **I finally found a library that does high performance visualisations on the browser:** https://threejs.org/examples/?q=graph#webgl_geometry_hierarchy2 it doesn't have graph layout built in, but has the performance to build graph layout on top of.

### [[Cause Prioritization]]
#### [[Best altruistic projects for the next 50 years]]
##### AI safety

##### Animal welfare

##### "generalized approaches to societal collective action problems" [[Getting Along]]

##### "general improvements to human effectiveness"

#### [[Most important thing we could do this decade]]
##### AI safety stuff

##### Discovering new moral foundations (what is the fundamental value? what is consciousness?)

##### Discovering a new Cause X

##### Making EA good

#### [[What would I do with $1000000]]
##### I actually have no idea what I would do with that

##### Perhaps a program to find talent and bring it into EA

##### [[Qualia Research Institute]]

##### Would do AI safety, but they're more talent constrained

##### I think the EA space needs more organizations. It would be 

#### [[Career]]
##### AI safety, collective action, "general improvements to human effectiveness"

### [[Crux]]es
#### How likely is AGI? How likely is [[Fast Takeoff]]?

#### Are there [[Logarithmic Scales of Valence]]?

#### Are current political problems leading up to some calamity?

### Shortlist::
#### What important fields have I not heard about yet?

#### What am I ignoring?

## [[JS]][[Performance]]
### `delete object.property` is very slow compared to `object.property=undefined`

### `switch` vs `const test=...; if(test==x)` have same performance for what I tried

## [[DataHike]] watched the talk about it, that seemed like 100% sales.

## [[TabNine]] is so good

### [[HTML5 Canvas]] setting up your visible area
#### Right now I have my data on a scale of 0 to 1, and scale that to the available width and height. I also store the

#### There are [[QuadTree]]s, [[OcTree]], but does [[Marc ten Bosch]] have a [[HexaTree]]?

#### Quad tree repulsion looks good with up to 1:1 box-to-distance threshold.

#### It now handles the [[Roam Help]] graph! This loads in 1.5-3 seconds (plus 4 seconds to load 7M roam json export)
