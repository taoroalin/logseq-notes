## [[Graph Layout]][[Force Layout]]
### lone nodes are too far out towards the edge in small graph. In extremely large graph, lone nodes are smushed too close in.

## [[Steve Woolf]]
### "opening up paths in front of you"

### [[Roam]][[Improvements]]
#### Is there any way to autocomplete local file names?

### "You're narrowing your focus too much with virtual reality"

### [[Textual Product]]
#### [[Steve Woolf]]
##### journalists, historians, writers

#### [[Tao Lin]]
##### research, programming, education, search

### Video takes time and money to make. If video / visual media were to become the default mode of knowledge, it would need to be much easier to make.
#### It's just far more information. Good video is a lot of informaiton, and it's hard to make all that information good information.

### [[Eastern Future Behind]]
#### I think this is more societal / governmental than conceptual. doesn't actually matter for my knowledge.

## [[Roam]][[Performance]][[Improvements]]((ff61f7ac-28ab-4105-8ec0-e626d1dbbb74))
### Roam performance logging. If Roam doesn't already have performance logging (which I don't know ), then one of the biggest things we could do to improve performance is send logs of performance (from everyone or select people) back to HQ.

## [[Graph Layout]] if I ever want 3D web graph layout, https://threejs.org/examples/?q=particle#webgl_points_billboards looks like a decent place to start

### "Finance is like the [[C++]] of money. Like you should have just stuck with C, but now you are always talking about these things that don't really exist, but the real shit is actually still down there but no one knows how to use it"

## [[Unity]] [[gametorrahod]] https://gametorrahod.com/tag/unity-ecs/

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]][[Performance]] sometimes typing single chars has a delay of a few frames. This isn't a huge problem, but I don't like it. Something like incremental parsing from partial parser state, or just finding cruft in code, could speed this up.

## TODO [[Graph Layout]]
### Support gradually adding adding nodes in chronological order to show the building of the graph.

## [[JS]][[Performance]]
### If I store mass on the node, I'll store the inverse mass as well to avoid having to divide by it often

### If you reload a page multiple times, the first time is the slowest, the second time is the fastest, and it slowly gets slower from there
#### {{[[drawing]] null}}

#### My guess is that it has has to load / parse / JIT the [[JS]] the first time, has all that stuff cached by the second time, and gets slower after that because [[Memory Fragmentation]]

## Okay [[Alan Kay]] is good! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSD07U5uBs [[Top]]  Found this while looking through my visualization of the [[Roam Help]] graph!
### "it's when you choose this building block that anyone can understand and try to use it for everyting" "It's the inability to fix the building blocks that's wrong with programming today. People just won't do it!"
#### This is so true!!!!!

### "wires together fires together" "theory" of neuroscience similar to erosion. water flowing through ditch makes ditch bigger, in positive feedback

### "Xerox PARC paid for itself 200 times over with the lazer printer alone"
#### I did have a misconception about this. It totally makes sense that [[PARC]] paid for itself!

## [[Roam]][[Improvements]] Allow creating a new block inside a query. This block is automatically on the current page under some tags satisfying query.
### For example: {{}}

### actually this might be unneccessary complexity...

## [[Graph Layout Todo]]

## [[Roam]]
### Roam has a similar problem with queries as [[C++]] has with templates. Lots of people avoid using c++ templates because they take too long to compile. In order to make the most out of queries, we want people to be able to use then without worrying about performance.

## I'm writing something over here that doesn't link

## [[Graph Layout]][[Performance]]
### [[Firefox]] uses less total CPU (as per Task Manager) than Chrome on my website. it's not just inefficient, it also uses less power.

### [[QuadTree]] Mine usually goes 9 levels deep. That's not too deep!

### Currently my source file is 10K, gzipped (not minified) is 3.2K

### Looks like precomputing `node.x-node2.x` and passing it into a function takes longer than recomputing it inside that function. Means if there's any performance to get by precommputing something tiny like that, it would have to be inline.

### [[Priority]] By far, most time is spent on `repelNodeByQuadTree`. This needs to get optimized!
#### I seem to get a performance increase by changing the order of my `if...else if ...` so the most common case comes first. Good thing to know!

### It takes 70% longer to render text background and text together (as opposed to rendering all the labels and then all the texts)

### vs this

### Looks like everything takes 110% longer on Firefox. Still has acceptable-ish performance though!

### Running the Chrome profiler drops my framerate from 60-100 to 30-40. The profiler would still be useful if every function's performance was effected by profiling overhead equally, but I doubt that's the case. That makes me doubt how useful the chrome profiler is for super fast things...
#### TODO Measure whether some things are more impacted by profiler overhead

### right now I'm spending 0.4ms per frame printing the framerate. That's like 4% of my total frame time!
#### It's hard to imagine a faster DOM fps counter than this:
##### ```javascript
  const frameStatTime = performance.now();
  fpsCounterElement.innerText = Math.round(1000 / (frameStatTime - lastFrameStartTime));
  lastFrameStartTime = frameStatTime;```

##### If I want faster framerate counter I can do that in Canvas

### [[HTML5 Canvas]]
#### Dragging feels laggy unless my code and the computer monitor are above 100FPS (this is because of lag in browser. without that 60fps would feel responsive enough). Unfortunatly most people only have 60 fps monitors, so dragging will be meh.

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics Wow those are almost exactly electron orbitals!!!!!! there actually useful for something else too!
