## [[Function Level Front End Performance Tracker]]
### The Problem::
#### I don't know how the performance of my code has changed over time, and I don't automatically get a breakdown of where time is spent in my program.

#### 

### I want to be able to monitor the performance of my web code by function. For instance, things I want to track include
#### Load time

#### PhysicsTick time

#### [[HTML5 Canvas]] render time

#### editNode time

#### keyPress handler time

### Data I want for each one is
#### Average time, worst 10% time. 

#### Maybe graph of time taken / call

#### {{[[drawing]] null}}

#### 

## [[Book Recommendations]]
### [[Logicomix]]

### 

## [[Graph Layout]]
### DONE Paint nodes in batches. For example, paint all backgrounds for 100 nodes, then paint all foregrounds for 100 nodes, then move on to the next. 

### The force functions I have aren't quite what I want. 

### **Changing font size on each node only adds 25% render time**!!!! I expected it to be soooo much worse!

## [[JS]][[Performance]]
### speedcurve takes 50ms startup

### logRocket spends 70ms loading a script on first thread idle

### My profileNewTopLevelFunctions takes 10ms
