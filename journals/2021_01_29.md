## [[AI Safety]] This is bad news for AI safety https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1355347393399631873

## TODO [[JS]][[Performance]]
### check what's the fastest way to "check the type" of object

## [[Project]] Make a better regex integration. Basically integrate https://regex101.com into vscode

## [[Roam Parser]]
### Order of regexes made NOWHERE NEAR as much difference as I would have expected. In a straightforward computer with no out of order execution, no compiler optimizations, ect, putting regexes in wrong order could slow you down by 10x. Here it slowed down by 1.9x, tops.

### [[Parser Test]]
#### $$hello [[link]]$$

#### ** bold ** ** not bold [[ hi]] **

### **OH MY GOD MY O(N^2) WORST CASE PARSER STILL ONLY TAKES 6s for 500KB**. it's literally checking every character 5k times. this is crazy.

### [[Qualia Research Institute]]

## [[Discussion Norms]]
### i really don't know. just be good?

### Better to have like 3 people in a discussion group.

### It's good when the leader shuts people up when they talk for too long?

### [[Francis Devlin]]
#### Likes when others play devil's advocate

### [[Giacomo]]
#### try too understndand eachothr

#### Go along with premises as group to take arguments to their conclusions

### [[Nora Ammann]]
#### [[Hand Signs]]
##### Hand:: new point

##### Finger:: direct response

##### Fist:: need clarification

#### Notice use of jargon.

## [[Getting Along]]

## [[Pairing people]]
### ```javascript
people = []
for(let i=0;i<people.length;i++){
  const shifted = 
}```

## [[Roam Parser]][[Performance]]
### As I suspected, string comparisons are very fast. Can do over 100,000,000 in 1 second.

### Built in [[edn]] parsing is the same speed as my first attempt parser for lots of short strings, but 5x slower for extremely long strings. Much better performance than [[Instaparse]]

### For some reason my toy lisp parser is about as fast as
