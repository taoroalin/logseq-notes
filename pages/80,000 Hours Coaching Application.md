## **What risks posed by artificial intelligence do you think most need more people working on them and why?**
### Although narrow artificial intelligence impacts liberty, policy, war, ect, general artificial intelligence is extremely important to the long run future, on a scale similar to all of humanity. I think research into general theories of optimization and alignment need the most attention.

## **Tell us how you’re currently thinking about your career. For example, what do you think your top options are, and what are their biggest pros and cons?*******
### I am quantitative, interested in science/rationality, philosophy, and computing. I am in my first or second year of university, and have time to explore before committing to a carreer. My top two choices are AI safety research and developing knowledge management systems/rationality tools/science tools, things in the vein of Roam Research.  I am already familiar with machine learning, and from books/talks/research papers I've read, AI safety research seems very appealing. I plan to get research experience in AI/ML soon, but I'm also curious if there's a cheaper way to test for personal fit for AI safety. A carreer in AI safety is very likely to fail and requires lots of education, but is intellectually stimulating. Software engineering (or similar) in a highly useful field like rationality tools is also very appealing, more achievable than AI safety, builds more flexible carreer capital, and could involve earning to give at the same time. I have done one internship and some small software projects, and can imagine doing it for a long time. My mode carreer option, assuming success was guaranteed, would probably be working at MIRI.

## **Tell us about one or two things that you think are amongst your most impressive achievements.*******
### Winning my university robotics competition twice in a row, and restarting the small Effective Altruism club I at my university.

## **Tell us about any interest or involvement you’ve had in effective altruism.**
### I discovered EA from a friend who was peripherally involved, and it immediately made far more sense than anything else to me. At least consciously, I don't really have goals besides Effective Altruism. Right now I'm trying to restart my university's effective altruism club after it dissolved last year.
