## Concord Personal Bio
### Instead of online college, I'm working remote for Concord, because Concord's calls can actually keep me awake. The only class I miss from school is linear algebra (no, this is not a joke. I may yet become a mathematician). When I'm not working in Javascript, I enjoy writing programs that write programs in Clojure. I enjoy mountain biking, running, and unicycle riding. For fun I read hard science fiction and play card games. Nowadays, I live back with my family in Massachusetts.
