## Arguemnt with Luna on the value of emotion and local kindness vs theory-based [[Morality]] and [[Rationalism]] with [[Ideological Turing Test]]
### I have found that I'm not quite done with our discussion. One way we might continue this more civilly is to each summerize each other's position, to make sure we understand what each other already said. This practice is based on the Ideologcal Turing Test: https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html  

### Ripple effects more important than simple causal effects, such as medicine & money?
#### Tao: You seem to be saying "Consequences of local good based on emotion & empathy are bigger than consequences of impersonal, scientific good." and "Good cannot be measured, or estimated to any useful accuracy". These beliefs are mutually exclusive. In order to justifiably declare one greater, they need to each be assigned a quantity and compared. If the most important thing in life cannot be quantified, or given a magnitude, then comparing magnitudes of things idn't morally relevent. In other words: The position that good cannot be measured can be consistent, but what is the evidence for it?

#### Luna: Emotions are the root of morality. Interacting with other people through scientific, impersonal means can cause you to mistake measures of wellbeing with wellbeing itself, and end up causing effects that aren't actually good. 

#### Steel man: Humans are very complex, and we don't know whether humans can be completely explained by science. Because science cannot always 

### Making decisions based on probabilities bad?
#### All animals make decisions based on incomplete information and heuristics and probabilities. When you do something nice for someone else, are you completely sure they'll like it? I don't think so. There is always a chance you got it wrong. 

#### When you introduce yourself to someone in a big party, or any other situation where you don't have time to meet everyone, you don't pick people to talk to completely at random. You see some clues in other people that influence whether you talk to them. None of these clues are conclusive: any one of them has the potential to become your best friend, but your behaviour of intentionally talking to some reveals that you don't think that is equally likely for all.

#### All I'm doing is making the unconscious probabilities conscious.

#### Humans routinely underestimate low probabilities, and tend to forget old data, so using explicit probabilities could be more accurate and advantageous.

### Respecting other people
#### Between the ages of 0 and 16 I did not understand the concept of respect. For the first ~13 years I only heard that word from my father, used in the form "You did ___? Don't you have any common respect?" He never explained what respect meant, so I interpreted it as meaning "daddy's feelings are hurt." Dad was the most enigmatic person in my life, and I told myself it was impossible to satisfy him, and didn't try. Between 16 and 18 I understood it. Sadly, I think this was because my awesome robotics mentor Ken Stafford, former air force colonel, got past my defenses and forced me to respect him. 

#### In the past year I have studied data science, AI, and psychology, which have made me confused about how to apply respect. The essence of it is: Sometimes I have far more evidence for my side than someone else does for theirs. In those cases their opinion tells me more about them and their life than about the broader world.

#### For example, I saw this figure in a scientific paper a few months ago ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fgraphminer%2FuK2OSx9ocJ?alt=media&token=194df0e4-1618-4d2b-ae03-321d9d0a9869)

#### Suppose I meet someone who says "Reducing my use of plastic bags is my way to contribute to reducing climate change." What are the chances that plastic bags actually contribute significantly to climate change, given the direct scientific evidence against it and its theoretical ridiculousness? Practically zero. Therefore while I respect this persons feelings, their opinions about the greater world won't significantly change mine.

#### I need to be open minded and or curious
##### I completely agree that I need to be more open minded.

#### [[Ideological Turing Test]] Luna's position
##### 

##### Life is beautiful. Life is fun. As all wise, and most old people can attest to, a happy life requires listening to your emotions. 

##### Philosophers have spent 2500 years seeking a theory of morality, yet have not created a theory of morality that feels right to me or the majority of people. It is therefore likely morality is beyond the reach of all theories. Given that, one should act based on introspection and empathy, the roots of morality.

##### Tao has an emotional need for more human connection & intimacy in his life.  In order to achieve this, especially with women his age, he needs to take others seriously even when they aren't able to defeat him in debate. If not, others will feel opressed worthless.
###### I essentially agree, but has some clarifications.

##### 

#### Let's define "valid"
##### Luna's definition: Accepted as equally valuable as your own emotions

##### Tao's defintion: Logically correct

#### Outtakes
##### Respect is defined as "due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others" and "to consider worthy of high regard"

##### Example: someone tells me "My mom's gonna kill me." I don't interpret that literally, because it is literally unlikely. I choose a more probable interpretation, "My mom is very angry with me." That is an example of a statement about something physcal, namely their murder, but it's reasonable to interpret it as only referring to emotions, not the external world. We can probably agree on that.

##### Now there are other similar situations. For example, someone says "The United States is not a geopolitical hyperpower." Should I now change my mental model of geopolitics? I have read newspaper articles, all of which assert that there are no hyperpowers besides the U.S. I have discussed geopolitics with very knowledgeable people, all of whom ascribe superpower, if not hyperpower, status to the U.S. You probably

##### Here are some positions I think you took earlier. Please tell me if I'm getting something wrong.

##### Most valuable: Taking people seriously
###### We all talk to each other
