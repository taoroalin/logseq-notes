## Cixin Liu
### The great bridge of Eastern Science Fiction: [[Three Body Problem]] [[Remembrance of Earth's Past]] Book 1

### The second book: slow, rational, and lonely: [[The Dark Forest]]

### The third book, my favorite: [[Death's End]]

### Cixin Liu has a very good short fiction anthology: [[The Wandering Earth]]

## Ted Chiang
### Not as Chinese, but perhaps an even better science fiction writer than Cixin Liu

### Second Anthology: [[Exhalation]]
