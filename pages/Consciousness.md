title: Consciousness

## Annaka Harris calls inconsequential epistemics, like "matter is mostly made.of empty space", "important". I don't agree

## I am very reluctant to believe completely individual experiences like personal consciousness

## If consciousness is epiphenomenal and doesnt cause anything, why does the universe have mechanisms that cause people to talk about consciousness? Why would we evolve mechanisms that precisely emulate something external-to-universe? 

## Does delay finding really show consciousness isn't in control? Could just be in control but have very delayed inputs and outputs.

## Ouiji board study shows that we narrativize past events, not that we narrativize present events
