## This book is super valuable. There seems to be a pattern with people who I really like, which is the more life crises the better. Bill Gates had 2, DFW had 1 or more. Neal Stevensen may believe the same, as per moirans in Seveneves. Counterexamples: Cixin Liu?

## He's disillusioned with the world, especially media, he knows it's making him depressed, and he still covers it. Why can't he stop?

## His world is "fractured." Whyyyyyyyyy. People's actions contradicting their words isn't a fracture in the universe. Why did he give up?
