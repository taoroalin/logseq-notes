## Bugs:
### Finish internationalization

### Doesn't work with left to right

### input mask turns "05/05/2020" into "M5/05/2020"

### All picker days are NaN. This may only effect development.

### input doesn't mask off min and max month and day

### Picker doesn't default to allowed month

### Must select later start date twice to set

### Initial value prop doesn't effect typedValue or effect the input value

### valueStart and valueEnd don't change

### Input doesn't mask off end date before start date
