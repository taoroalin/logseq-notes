title: Death's End

## Most awe inspiring book I've ever read.

## Plays on my mommy issues

## Portrays femininity as a terminal weakness of humanity

## Love the Orion Arm chapter. It's like a condensed version of Trisolaris, aliens shaped by nature and first principles.

## I love Liu's integration of modern physics ideas
### Folding dimensions of string space from macro to micro would change laws of physics, likely including gravity

### Curvature propulsion doesn't quite make sense because space is already flat

###
