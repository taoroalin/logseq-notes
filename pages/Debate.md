#### Require lots of tax dollars

#### Denies people right to trade

##### Innovative, risky education programs, such as Lambda School which teaches coding and is paid for by cut of salaries made after graduation, wouldn't be invented by a government system.

###### Yeah, this is extremely hard to use, perhaps not in future

##### **Decreases cognitive diversity which would decrease innovation**

#### Problem of student loans
