## Formats
### 10 second

### 1 minute

### 5 minute

### 15 minute (talking points)

## Angles
### It's the rational thing to do

### I realized what I was doing was useless, and found a way to really contribute

### 

### It makes life meaningful (prolly hopeless)

## **Effective Altruism is applying evidence, reason and rationality to the goal of making the world a better place.**

## Is it OK to use fake anecdotes? Probs not workable for me. If the likelihood of the events in the story is high, then it doesn't matter whether it happened to me or someone else, but to some that's cheating :(

## I’m interested in an idea called "[effective altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism)" which is about not just doing things to make the world a better place, but about thinking about what can do to make their helping go the __furthest__. For example, if I could spend an hour and help a person cross the street that would be cool, but if I could spend an hour and cure blindness in three different people, that would be __even cooler__.

## Personal Experience Being Ineffective
### Two days ago, I went on a volunteering trip with some fellow college students to a local non-profit organization. We arrived at their building and proceeded to help them clean their air vents, tables, chairs, walls, and ceiling fans. And then we left.

### There were seven of us and we were all there cleaning for an hour each. However, imagine that, instead of volunteering ourselves, we paid a janitor minimum wage to do the cleaning instead. I suspect that the janitor would accomplish our tasks in less than seven hours given that the janitor is more trained and will require less oversight and explanation of the task from the management. Hiring a janitor is simply much more efficient than continuing to get confused college students to do the volunteering.

### I 3D printed robotic hands "for disabled children with no hands." The problem was, we never found children who actually needed the hands. The supply was too high for the demand, and our group never even talked to a real disabled person in 2 years. That's not altruism, it's fantasy.
