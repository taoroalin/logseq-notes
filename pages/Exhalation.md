## This collection is extraordinary. It's value rests in two jems: "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling" and "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom."

## "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling" is about the difference in life based on feeling and life based on fact, and how the former is easier, sometimes happier, but ultimately less fulfilling, less fair, and makes us less effective than the latter. This is a small part of the argument that we would be better as cognative cyborgs, and one that I totally agree with.

## Although Chiang's other stories about time travel were good, I was struck by how disconnected they were from the real world, with it's increasing entropy and forward time. "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom" is the polar opposite of those stories. Instead of assuming constant entropy and determinism, it explores the moral and psychological implications of chaos theory. It is a tale of the burden of regret and the futility of wishing for what we, or those we love, can't have. As someone who is often worrying about how my actions impact others, this story helped me grapple with how to have reasonable expectations for myself and everyone else.
