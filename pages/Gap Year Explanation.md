title: Gap Year Explanation
---

## I took college courses during high school, and although I got good grades, I didn't like them. They were biased, and intellectually lazy. I got into bad relationships with all my teachers. I got depressed, and took a year off of school. 

## After a year off, I realized that in order to be happy, I need to be around more people, and in order to do that I need to accept people as they are. So I went to UBC Vancouver, where I am now.

## I am taking either one or two semesters off from university right now during lockdowns.
