### Dear Diane Grinspoon,

### I'm Tao Lin, Steve's granson. Pleased to meet you!

### I'm so happy you engaged with the ideas of Effective Altruism! As a bit of background, I'm not a founder of Effective Altruism, I just lead the small chapter at my university. The movement as a whole was started around 2013 by philosophers like Peter Singer and William MacAskill, but now has thousands of members including philosophers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and more in support of the most high-impact causes.

### Actually, at least two philantropists in The Giving Pledge are already familiar with Effective Altruism: Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna. They would probably love to talk to you about applying evidence and rationality to your philanthropy, and there are lots of other great people who you can connect to are more knowledgeable than I am.

### A bit about effective altruism: 

### **Effective Altruism is applying evidence, reason and rationality to the goal of making the world a better place.** It is a method of rigorously considering all the ways you can do good, and acting on the best one. 

### The one book that communicates effective altruism most clearly is probably [The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/the-book/)

### [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) is an organization that helps young people choose the carreers that will make the most impact. 

### The university club I run is meant to help students think more deeply about how they can do good in the world. I just started it last month, and plan to spend time growing it in the next few years. 

### I'm very interested in helping future generations because although Our actions have big consequences on future generations future generations don't get a vote on how we treat them. I will try to use my carreer to help prevent existential threats to humanity, things like asteroid impacts. You can read more about helping the very long term future here: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future/

### I would love to hear back from you about altruism and the Giving Pledge meeting in May. I think bringing up Effective Altruism there would be extremely good, but I don't know if I'm the best person to do it and I would love to talk to you about that.

### Here's how I found effective altruism:

### I first thought about effectively helping others when I was volunteering for my Bar Mitzvah. I first tried cooking food at a homeless shelter. I was kvelled for it, but I couldn't help but notice that the adult volunteers had to help me constantly. They could have cooked better, faster, if I wasn't there. I didn't feel like the people I was helping really needed me. For my Bar Mitzvah, and afterward, I tried to give more effectively. I tutored 3rd grade kids in math, taught robotics to 6th grade kids, and ran STEM events in local schools. There I felt like I had a bigger impact, but the students I was helping often had lives just as full and happy as mine.

### Then, a year ago when I was 18, I found Effective Atruism. It 

### Later, in high school, I designed and built low-cost prostetic hands for disabled children with a project called E-Nabe. I was good at it, I didn't need anyone to tell me what to do. Once we actually started talking to people in our community who needed the prosthetics, though, it turned out that our product wasn't the best fit for any particular person, and they all got their prosthetics elsewhere. I don't think our prosthetics ended up helping anyone. my domain, science and engineering, but I wasn't able to make an impact because I didn't know the needs of the people I was helping. Then last year in September I stumbled across the Effective Altruism movement.

### Learning about effective altruism totally changed my attitude towards giving. I now feel I have the tools to solve the world's problems. 

### Right now I'm in university, and I'm starting a club to help people find carreers where they can have the most impact.

### I'm honored that offered to mention me to Bill Gates, but i
