### Book

### Doing Good Better: How Effective  Altruism Can Help You Help Others, Do Work that Matters, and Make Smarter Choices about Giving Back: William MacAskill:

### [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592409660/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_i_BSjsEbP3P](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592409660/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_i_BSjsEbP3PEXMA)

### Book:

### "Effective altruism is built upon the simple but profound idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the "most good you can do." Such a life requires an unsentimental view of charitable giving: to be a worthy recipient of our support, an organization must be able to demonstrate that it will do more good with our money or our time than other options open to us."

## Her email: 
### So glad we got a chance to catch up. The Giving Pledge is around May 28/29 in CA

### I would love your grandson to  get to know Bill Gates. I am thinking if he wants to  send me a packet material

### Or a letter of what he is working on I will give it to Bill and say a word or two   about him

### Much love Diane
