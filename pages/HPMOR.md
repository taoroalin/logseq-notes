## Notes
### Questions
#### How does he get intuitions about magic n quarrel n Voldemort?
##### Querrel is Voldemort

#### Why mention theory that Harry is DEEP sleeper agent planted by conspiracy?

#### Who was Zabini working for?

#### What are Querrel's motives? What is Querrel's background? How much influence does Voldemort have on him?
##### Important question: can Voldemort control himself enough to still want to kill Harry and kill mudbloods?
###### Based on the infanticide scene, no.

###### Did he change on his own after spending lots of time in horcrux state, or is Querrel behind it?
####### Most probable: Just as Voldemort is attempting to use Querrel, Querrel is attempting to use Voldemort to create global peace and prosperity

####### Also probable: Voldemort is in control, has matured, and will posess Harry after he gains power

#### Cloak of Invisibility given by Dumbledore?
##### Yes.

#### What happened to Narcissa Malfoy?

#### What is the mirror?

#### What is the role of the Sorcerrer's Stone, if any?

#### Why is Harry acting all nervous & incompetent?

#### Who sent the appirition to set Hermione against Draco & Snape?

### Surprising Data
#### Dumbledore told Harry to carry "a rock from his parents house" with him at all times

#### Someone told zigetti the plan to even the scores, be the last one standing, and make sure everyone wins, then tell quirrel Dumbledore told him to do it.

#### Someone put an invitation to the Salem School under Harry's pillow, which is a portkey going to London after he threatened snape

#### Someone made an appirition appear to Hermione and set her against Snape and Draco

#### Quirrel broke Belletrix out of Azkeban

#### Quirrel said the forbidden hallway is completely impassable, but someone said lots of Gryffindor kids got to the mirror

#### Dumbledore burned Narcissa alive, according to Draco

#### Harry had a ridiculous 26 hour sleep cycle (if it's not just for the one "you gave me a time machine to treat my sleep disorder" gag and because Macgonagal wanted to give Harry an advantage (there are pills for that))

#### Quirrel used plot against bullies to blackmail Snape

#### 

### Keep in mind
#### A spell can tell whether there is a Deathly Hallow level artifact nearby

### Failed
#### Game? I thought it was Dumbledore and premonition, and then himself or snape and premonition, not him and time Turner.
##### Didnt think of all the possible types of retrocausal influence

### Why "don't mess with time?"
####
