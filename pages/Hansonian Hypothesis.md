## Core thesis of [[RobinHanson]] 

## Explicit goals besides reproduction of replicating, naturally selecting patterns such as genes, culture, and memes are often rationalizations of reproductive motives created to gain social resources.

## Humans evolved an innate drive to be seen as positively impacting their community in order to win mates and favors from their community. Humans developed drives to signal to others that they provided utility. Signalling that you act out of others' best interest convinces them you provide utility. Humans have evolved mechanisms for projecting compassion without true compassionate motives.
