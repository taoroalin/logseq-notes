## App idea: Calendar that visualizes time as a nested helix fractal

## intro animation: show the solar system from above, spinning. Orbit to the side and see the whole thing's moving upwards, tracing a helix. Zoom in on earth, and show the earth rotating, tracing a 2 fractal helix. Zoom in to a clock, and see the hour hand
