### However, if you’ve got a little more time to put into investing, I think it’s worth considering the idea of tilting your investments towards assets that have value (are cheap based on metrics like P/E and P/B), high momentum (have gone up in the last 12 months, are above their 200-day moving average) and low volatility. If you do this within equities, I think it’s possible to beat the market by a couple of percentage points.

### Finally, you can boost your returns by avoiding assets that other investors hold for non-economic reasons. For instance, UK pension funds are legally required to hold a large amount of long-term inflation-linked UK government bonds, so the yields on these bonds are unusually low. Avoiding these bonds can boost your returns. Some assets that might fall into this category include: government bonds in general (banks are required to hold them); corporate bonds, municipal bonds and real estate (often held due to favourable tax treatment, so less attractive if this tax relief doesn’t apply to you); gold (held by central banks without the aim of maximising returns).

### Buying value stocks right now **would involve loading up on Russian equities**. If you feel averse to doing that, or averse to telling your partner you put the retirement money in the Russian stock market, then you can see why this bias persists.

## Big Bets. Smallish companies that are underrated, are in underrated fields, pursue goals that are hidden from us.
