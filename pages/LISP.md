### Regular Expression

### #"regexp"

### REPL tricks
#### *1 is last result, *2 is second to last result, ect.

### (defn name [params] (body))

### str converts to string, then appends string form of rest of list :)

### Installing Clojurescript: Installs through dependency in deps.edn file! Need to be in directory of project with deps.edn to install!
