## Introduction to EAs
### Hi,

### I first found a reference to Effective Altruism in the book "Against Empthy" (yes, really) and it immediately made more sense to me than anything ever has.

### I'm a huge fan of the 80,000 Hours podcast.

### In my current estimation, long term concerns are the most pressing, especially management of radical technologies like AI.

### I am an undergraduate student of computer science.

### I like audiobooks, cycling, and puzzle videogames.

### My current pet virtue is taking every single question that comes your way seriously.
