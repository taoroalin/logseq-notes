## Interpretations of modern physics
### Interpretations of quantum [[Sean Carroll]]'s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6FR08VylO4
#### Real rules, as per RQM
##### Hilbert Space

##### Schrodinger equation

#### Unnecessary rules
##### Measurements associated with operator

##### Born rule

#### Measurement is entanglement between apparatus and measured. After the apparatus is entangled, it becomes entangled with environment, which is what we call decoherence. This factorizes the (0,1)*(m0,m1) to (0m0, 1m1)

#### Wavefunctions become orthogonal in Hilbert Space. One axis difference causes orthogonal?

#### Self locating uncertainty
##### After apparatus entangled, there is a moment e-22s where you see an entangled apparatus

#### Mad dog everetianism: start with a Hilbert Space, hamiltonian, and stare vector. Derive everything else, even space itself

#### Quantum cosmology

#### Bulk entanglement gravity

#### What if we're in the zero energy eiganstate
##### Time is emergent

#### What if dimensionality of Hilbert space is finite?
##### Infinite Hilbert space in finite space space creates black hole, therefore quantum gravity has finite dims

##### Dimensionality of region of space is e to area of boundary of region in Planck units squareda

#### Cosmic no hair theorem: universe asymptotic to de sitter space

#### Entropy asymptotically approaches visible universe black hole

#### Entropy of ou is e120, dim is exp entropy

#### If infinite Hilbert, infinite algebras of observables

#### Where did modes that used to be smaller than Planck length come into existence

#### Expansion of space is just previously too small qubits coming into existence

#### N<75 e folds

#### Desitter space has t=H/2Pi

#### Predicts same as youngness argument, but says not being boltzman brain rules it out

#### Boltzman brain not problem if infinite total h space

#### Emergence of spacetime
##### Problem with ads cft is negative cosmological constant

##### Democratus?

##### K-local: only interacts with K other Qbits aka dims. This only works in specific initial states, like ours. This creates topology 

##### Looking local is baked into initial energy levels

#### Entropy is ignorance of state. Entropy is amount of entanglement of system to rest of u

#### Geometry changes to maintain equal entropy everywhere. 

#### Quantum error correction causes classical stability?

#### Lorentz invarients don't work with finite local dimensional h space

### Can't define observation

## I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics
