## Moral Foundations
### Universal Uncertainty questions
#### Alone in the universe?
##### Lots of Drake filters

##### Single Great Filter

##### Youngness Argument

##### Refined Anthropic Principle argument

##### [[The Dark Forest]]

#### How connected are consciousness & complexity?
##### Panpsychism
###### Integrated Information Theory

#### How connected are consciousness & ( happiness & suffering)

#### Infinite Inflation?

#### Many Worlds?

#### Simulation?

#### "Higher"
##### [[Rationally Speaking]]'s analysis of Pascal's Wager made the case for taking the wager seriously. To me, there are significant "filters" in the way. 
###### God has a motive to create people or universe or earth or whatever

###### God rewards humans

###### "Getting in" with God requires something not already covered by [[Effective Altruism]]
####### This alone seems counterintuitive.

###### God somehow implanted knowledge of itself into humanity
####### Through telepathy?

####### Through physical manipulation?

####### Through carefully setting up initial conditions of universe to eventually create belief in God?

###### Knowledge of God persists in non-introspective form OR knowledge of God can be found through introspection

###### Christian God is significantly more likely than contradictory gods

#### Occam's Razor Good?
##### Regardless of whether we're talking about truth or morality, you are thinking of hypotheses, and hypothesis space is always infinite. You can always say "Aliens did it" or "The simulation controllers did it" or "God did it" or whatever.  If not Occam's Razor, we still need some way to reject hypothesis a priori. Brains are lazy, and seem to apply Occam's Razor, at least in terms of logical complexity, automatically. I'll keep using it until it's proven wrong, and probably keep using it after that. 

##### Other ways of rejecting stuff a priori:  prior that humanity as a whole contains all the knowledge we need, but no individual has enough of it, therefore the space is limited to what anyone's come up with.

##### No amount of constraining evidence will get rid of the infinite hypotheses. In order to end up with a proper probability distribution among hypotheses, something needs to squash them down. Occam's Razor is the most obvious way to do that (I like the [Solomonoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference) version).

### Consequentialist Goods
#### Reducing Suffering

#### Increasing Happiness

#### Increasing Complexity

#### Constant Progress

#### Maximum State (as opposed to integrated state)
##### Refuted by relativity of simultenaety, there is no time slice of universe

#### The Question of Preferences
##### What are preferences?
###### Personality is at the core of preferences. Personality is built from genes and the last few years of experiences.

###### Personal Identity

###### Group Identity

###### Relationships

###### 

##### Can something external infer preferences?

##### Is there a personal cost to disregarding preferences
###### Can I believe in consequentialism thoroughly enough to suffer no consequences for
####### ends justify means

####### disregarding preferences

####### Treating peoples' intrinsic and extrinsic value as unequal

## Applications
### Three Axis Virtue Model
#### Rationality
##### [[Rationalism]]
###### Weighted by the theory spaces / [[Abstract Landscapes]] the person operates in, such as physics, alignment, big data, ect

##### Intelligence

#### Alignment
##### Goal Alignment
###### [[Moral Foundations]]

###### Context dependent moral convergence

##### Monkey-brain-management
###### self awareness

###### Noise Reduced Human Nature Info ([[Psychology]] studies)

###### [[Personal Procedures]]

#### Information
##### Broad context knowledge, like Science

##### Narrow context knowledge

### Personalities
#### Seeker
##### Highest openness

##### Medium conscientiousness

##### 

#### Skeptic
##### Highest disagreeableness

##### Introverted

#### Cement
##### Standard desirable personality: high on everything
