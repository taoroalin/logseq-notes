## PSYC 102
### Let me look up

### Is there less bystander effect in collectivist cultures?

### Is a change in black quotas from 50 to 30 percent a likely cause of South Africa's rugby performance?

### Midterm 1 material
#### Chapter 1

#### Lol. You mean no one worth anything uses their psych degree?

#### Hone critical thinking? Learn scientific method? Psychology is probably negative at these things because it teaches you to be okay with lax standards!

#### Understand complex factors? It probably does actually give people an appreciation for complex systems.

#### You guys either never heard about counterfactuals, or you delude yourself into thinking its OK to decievee people about them

#### Wundt: Structuralism: Introspectively examining conscious experience to simple stimuli

#### James: Functionalism: How do behaviors function to improve survival? Looking at whole mind, not dividing into components

### Biology

### Vesicles are full of neurotransmitters

### Action potential pushes vesicles to edge of synapse

### Excitatory neurotransmitters cause receptors to let in sodium ions

### Sodium sets off action potential

### Inhibitory neurotransmitters release chlorine ions which inhibit action potential

### Some neurotransmitters get sucked back in through ion gates on the starting side by 5http serotonin transported

### Short Short alleles of 5-httlpr cause depression

### Norepinephrine:

### Seratonin:

### Neurotransmitters are localiszed to different parts of the brain

### Glutamate is found in 90% of brain
#### excitatory

#### dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate

#### inhibitory

#### seratonin, gaba

#### Serotonin mostly in limbic system and back of frontal cortex

### Inside axon is -, outside is +

### Action potential is wave of switched + and - outside and inside axon

### Personality Psychology

### Humans behave differently than each other in predictable ways

### Personality psychology is the study of the persistent differences between people
#### Freudian Psychodynamic or Psychosexual

#### Neo Freudians

#### Learning Theories

#### Human differences are learned during childhood and throughout life

#### Cycles of habits of body and mind

#### Not genetic or supernatural
##### Social Cognitive Approach
###### Reciprocal Determinism

###### Behavior → situational → cognitive → behavior

###### Behavior ← situational ← cognitive ← behavior

##### Locus of Control

##### Sovereignty

##### Do I decide meaning, or does something else?

#### Humanistic

#### Trait Theory

#### Cultural

#### Assessment

### Social Psychology

### How our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by surroundings
#### Attribution

#### Explanation of your own or others' behavior
##### Dispositional attribution

##### Personality predictions,

##### Situational Attributions

##### Self Serving Bias (success bias)

##### Explain our success with dispositional attribution, failure with situational explanation

##### Explain others' success with situational attribution, failure with dispositional attribution

##### Actor Observer Bias

##### Explain others' behavior with dispositional attribution

##### Explain our behavior with situational attribution

##### Correspondence Bias or Individuality Bias

##### Use dispositional attribution too much

##### Use situational attribution too little

##### Possibly only works for strangers or outgroup, maybe opposite for ingroup
###### And culture
####### Western

####### More attribution bias

####### Eastern

####### More situational, less personal achievement or attribution

####### More accurate attribution

##### Projection bias

##### We think others are similar to ourselves

#### Attitude

#### People want to hold correct attitudes?

#### People are conditioned away from bad attitudes and towards good ones
##### Affective

##### How you feel

##### Cognitive

##### What you think

##### Behavioral

##### How you behave

##### Changing Attitudes

##### Most studied topic in social psychology

####### Resolutions
######## Change behavior to justify attitude (Shape up)

######## Change attitude to justify behavior (Perhaps that was an orphaned beliefs) (Perhaps I have found something about myself I need to consider in my beliefs)
