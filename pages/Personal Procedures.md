## When something makes me sad
### Step 1: Recognize that I am feeling bad, and I need to do something about it.
#### Take a deep breath

#### It could be a lot worse

#### I'm still capable

#### I still have the power to make things better

#### I need to let go and fix things

### Step 2: Execute Some Emergency Actions. **figure out which of these I need to do**
#### Personal actions
##### Reach out to friends and family

##### Start therapy

#### Salvage actions
##### Repair relationships

##### Re-grade tests or such

##### Change plans, e.g. applying for job, summer classes, ect.

### Step 3: Learn. What surprised me? Was it other people, myself, or nature?
#### Common surprise areas
