## Although this has its issues, it opens up a vast realm of possibiliteis based on the question "What systems of capitalism would create the most growth?"

## The systems are based on the "mechanism design" field of game theory, which asks "What games will get people to do what we want?" e.g. add value to the economy. Capitalism is its own game that incentivizes people to make money, but in the modern world it isn't the most effective game.

## Systems:

## QV Voting for electing leaders, and for representitives in parliment, as well as shareholder-corperation voting

## Always-on-auction property with wealth tax (7%)

## Prevent institutional investors from owning competing businesses (Vangaurd, Fidelity, ...)

## Migrant sponsorship program that splits economic benefits of short-term work migrationb between migrants and low-skilled domestic workers.

## Criticisms

## Some of these policies are no-brainers, such as breaking up institutional investors. Others, like migrant sponsorship and QV voting, are probably very good but difficult to enact. Always-on-auction, which is the most radical, biggest economic impact policy (estimated economic growth of 25-50% from this alone), is the most questionable. It seems to me that this would require everyone to either pay unfair taxes to avoid disruptive buyouts, or micromanage their property portfolio (or have an alg do it). This effective increase in personal finance burden benefits people who are good at math, and disadvantages everyone else. People who have good property pricing/buying algs would make more profit by keeping them than by selling them to the poor. It seems to me that ML could permanently take over such a system, and buy up most of the property there is.
