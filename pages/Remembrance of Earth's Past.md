## Three Body was the first thing I read that seperated life from human nature, and that resonated very strongly with me. Even though his aliens are created to serve a human novel, they have an independence of humanity that feels liberating. The trisolarans are a particular solution to a particular problem, survival on trisolaris, and reveal the ways in which humanity is only one particular solution to one particular problem, namely survival on earth.

## Liu doesn't directly moralize macro social systems, which also feels liberating to me. He treats them as flawed, dynamic, and predictable rather than as fixtures of the universe.

## and as someone who feels personally wronged by human nature and human irrationality, I loved it.  I think I loved Death's End most because Liu's manipulation of modern physics, especially the curling of dimensions through dimensional strikes, lowering of the speed of light, and manipulating the curvature of space is thto his  modern physics in a way that .

## Remembrance of Earth's Past is my favorite book series ever. My favorite moments are

## I like Death's End because it is awe inspiring and has far-reaching revelations.
