## A key turning point in my life was when my wife declared that her biological clock said she wanted kids __now__. I hadn’t been thinking of kids, and the prospect didn’t inspire much passion in me; my life had focused on other things. But I wanted to please my wife, and I didn’t much object, so we had kids. I now see that as one of the best choices I’ve made in my life. I thank my wife for pushing me to it. https://www.overcomingbias.com/2018/06/be-a-dad.html
