title: Signalling

## Core argument for signalling: women's 1 desire in men is social status. Social status, unlike food, follows a pereto distribution where 20% of people get 80% of value. Therefore often in the [[Ancestral Environment]], only 1 in 10 or 17 men actually had children, backed up by anthropological and dna evidence. This social status culling factor is FAR higher than culling factors for any other resource. Therefore most of our evolution in the past few 100,000 years has been towards signalling, not basic needs as was more common before
