## My favorite stories were "Liking What We See" and "Understanding" and possibly "Division By Zero". Ted Chiang is able to integrate logical, plausible speculative fiction and human appeal like no one else. The spread of ideas in this collection is breathtaking.

## Reading "Understanding" feels like a guilty pleasure, and an admission, against beliefs I may find useful, that I too wish I had superhuman intelligence. Its core conflict, though, is one that I have struggled with for a long time. Is beauty or humanity more valuable? I am slightly on the side of beauty, but not nearly so much as the main character.

## "Liking What We See" has convinced me that it's core technology, calliagnosia, would be good for humanity. Calliagnosia is a selective blindness to physical attractiveness (like The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat). This would cause people to better choose partners who would make them happy in the long run, because happiness is unaffected by beauty, especially if everyone is percieved as equally attractive. This would cement our societal belief that natural selection among humans is bad, but there is practically no chance of ever recovering natural selection in our species, making any of its gains a pipe dream. The only way forward is to become more rational and evolve through cultural and technological means, and biological selection is soon to be obsolete.

## "Story of Your Life" was a very difficult read for me as a consequentialist. I threw stopped and cursed the book over and over again. It asked a question I had never thought of before, especially since I seriously adoped consequentialism. Are subjective experiences or perspectives of individuals that have no external consequences valuable? More specifically, because the Heptapod's seperation from time can be experienced but not shared or evidenced, there is no way that I could gather sufficient evidence to value it. There would be no way for an Effective Altruist to see the happiness that could be caused by seperation from time, even though seperation from time might be valuable
