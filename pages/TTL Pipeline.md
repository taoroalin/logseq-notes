## Get list of all tailwind classes https://tailwind.build/classes with copy paste
### {{Todo null}} find a more reliable way to get list of classes

## use regex to turn that paste into html like <div class="bg-red-400">
### extract computed-style with js

### take only computed style that's different than tailwind default <div>

## String builder in js to turnturns that json into [[LESS]] mixins

## import those mixins, and there you go!
