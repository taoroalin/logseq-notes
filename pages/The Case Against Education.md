title: The Case Against Education
---

## Evidence shows that education doesn't give you skills and doesn't make you smarter. You were smart all along and the school took the credit :)

## My main problem with this book is that it doesn't adequately consider the impact of education on voting and popular beliefs on political issues. Popular opinions on policy are often extremely counterproductive because people don't know or care about the larger systems, such as other countries and groups, that policies effect. This narrow-mindedness in voting is responsible for wars and many of the biggest global risks. Although schools aren't very good at broadening people's perspectives on large issues important to policy, I believe they should emphasize subjects like foreign languages and ideally trips to other countries to improve global stability, which can be far more important than the lost GDP from such non-job-value-added classes.
