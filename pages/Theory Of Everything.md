## What's my current most complete, somewhat sound theory of everything?

### #Metaphysics
#### All evidence is, when closes to our consciousness or whatever, information. Information, like existence, is implied by the very thought of it.

#### Nothing else is fundamental in the same way as information, in that all else can be disproven by evidence.
##### Information can in a sense be illusory. If you think you've come up with the smallest comptuter program to produce a result, and it requires a certain number of bits, then you might assume more information exists than actually does. 

##### What would it mean for a sequence of symbols to not come from a source of information at least as large as the min memory required to produce it in a program?
###### It might mean information could be added to the universe
