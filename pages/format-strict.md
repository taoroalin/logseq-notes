## I want everything to STRICTLY, DETERMINISTICALLY formatted for me

## I much prefer things on the next line to align with what's above

## remind you (or force you) to switch things to thread macro notation

## Special cases
### cond/condp/case: test and result always on the same line, starting on the same line as cond

### let: each declared var gets its own line unless all combined are < 25 chars, in which case 1 line with commas

### def/defn: docstring always gets its own line, params on same line as def(n)

### Map literals
