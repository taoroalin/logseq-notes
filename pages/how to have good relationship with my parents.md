#### **How to stop worrying your parents**

#### My parents used to worry about me constantly. They worried about everything from when I ate dinner to my grades at school to my career prospects. I didn't have a mental framework (or the maturity) to think about that worry, and as a result it compounded and ended up causing my family a whole lot of pain. A year and a half ago I found a mental framework that allows me to think about my parents much better, and have alleviated a lot of that worry. If your parents are worried about you all the time (or if you're a worried parent), then this may be useful.

#### Let's say I come home at 8 one night with a dead phone. My mom expected me at dinner, and has been texting me since then. My thoughts were "If I always come home at 3, I'll never see my friends. My mom will eventually learn that, and until then I'll just ignore her" (yes, I was that bad). I was imagining my parents' demands were universal and set in stone, and I would either have to obey them or rebel. 

#### Here was my problem. One day I would go on a walk after school. When I get back to my house, I find my mom crying. It turns out she'd been texting me every five minutes for the past few hours. Or I would complain about my teacher one day, and then my mom would ask me "Are you getting along with that teacher you mentioned?" over and over again for weeks.  Or I would eat dinner out one day, and the next morning I would find out my mom was worried, thinking I might not have eaten dinner at all. I was causing a half dozen concurrent worries at any given time.

#### Often I wouldn't know why she was worried. Then I would consider that worry "not my problem" and ignore it. Other times, I would figure out my mom was worried. Then I'd say 
"walking around in the woods is actually good for me. Next time I do that, don't be so worried" or "Oh, I actually switched classes a week ago. Everything's fine now." Neither of these were remotely useful. My parents, and others, tried to tell me what is doing wrong. I remember phrases like "she wants you to acknowledge her feelings" or "respect your mother," but none of it got to me at the time.

#### I think my fundamental problem back then, other than being an immature child, was that **I thought she worried about me because she didn't understand what I actually needed** and her worry was a misguided attempt to improve my life. This is somewhat true, but it was counterproductive for actually decreasing worry. My model now, which works much better is that we each have internal problems which make life harder for each other**. didn't separate my internal problems from her internal problems

#### P.S. All that was just a basic application of rationalist principles. What I feel I added is the idea that those principles don't have to drive you away from those who don't share them - in fact, they brought me closer to non-rationalists than I was before.

#### P.P.S. I will likely write another post describing the same core idea from another angle.

## Feelings caused by false beliefs are real

## Other people telling you to do something is about them, not you

## Some people 

## I trying to intervene in Alex's relationship with his parents good? It's definitely caused by my own desire to validate my process.

## Reference: my old hum journal from 2017?
### Bournedale was awesome! I took a leadership role in our group, and it felt very empowering. I don’t know what Kevin and Sathwik were thinking during some of the activities, but they stayed silent and didn’t follow what the group was doing. I wish I had talked to them outside the group to figure out what they were thinking. I feel kind of bad for bossing Kevin around. I don’t know how to lead everyone and empathize with the people who don’t participate at the same time. My mindset is that everyone in a team has to either contribute an idea or follow orders, but that doesn’t work for anyone with a laid back mindset or who isn’t interested in what the group is doing. Are a few non-participating people a flaw our group dynamics, or a cost of high-intensity teamwork?

### At home my mom thinks very slowly. So slowly that she rarely says something I didn’t already consider, and when I talk at my normal speed she doesn’t fully understand me and asks questions i’ve already answered. On the car drive after my mom picked me up after bournedale, whenever I stopped talking my mom would take about 15 seconds to say a single sentence with about 3 seconds between each word, and I decided to talk continuously the entire way so I wouldn’t have to listen to it.
